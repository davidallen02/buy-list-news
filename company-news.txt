2019-11-08	baba	Is moving ahead with plans to raise as much as $15 billion in a Hong Kong share sale, people with knowledge of the matter said, a major win for a city rocked by months of civil unrest. Alibaba?s share sale, which could be the largest globally this year, will be a triumph for a Hong Kong stock exchange that lost many of China?s brightest technology stars to U.S. rivals. The Chinese e-commerce giant had aimed to list as early as over the summer before pro-democracy protests rocked the financial hub, while trade tensions between Washington and Beijing clouded the market?s outlook. On Thursday, the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs on each other?s goods in phases as they work toward a deal. ?They probably want to minimize the risk from a U.S. trade war,? said Danny Law, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd. ?It makes a lot of sense.?

2019-11-01	baba	Posted a stronger-than-projected 40% surge in revenue, affirming the resilience of online consumer spending despite a rapidly cooling economy. It reported revenue of 119 billion yuan ($16.9 billion) in the September quarter, surpassing the 116.7 billion yuan average of analysts? estimates.  Alibaba reported a net income of 72.5 billion yuan, boosted by a one-time gain booked after it finalized the acquisition of a third of Ant Financial, the payments and fintech giant controlled by Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma. Revenue from the cloud division leapt 64% to 9.3 billion yuan. The results came just days ahead of Alibaba?s most important event of the year, the Singles? Day shopping extravaganza on Nov. 11, which last year netted more than $30 billion of sales over 24 hours.
2019-10-31	bmy	Said that U.S. sales have stalled for Opdivo, the cancer drug that makes up the core of the company?s growth. The drug is facing stiff competition from a rival therapy from Merck & Co. However, Bristol-Myers raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.25 to $4.35 a share, an increase of 5 cents from the outlook it provided in July, estimate $4.30 . Third-quarter sales were $6.01 billion, outpacing the $5.90 billion average of analysts? estimates.  U.S. sales of Opdivo declined by 5% in the quarter, compared with a year prior. The drop-off is a surprise for a promising new drug, since most pharmaceutical products enjoy periods of steady growth after being introduced. Overall revenue from the product was up 1% to $1.82 billion, thanks to sales overseas. More upbeat news came from Bristol-Myers? blood thinner Eliquis, which outperformed Wall Street estimates with a sales increase of 22% to $1.93 billion.  Bristol reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.07.
2019-11-04	brkb	The company?s cash pile hit a record in the third quarter, as Warren Buffett continued his hunt for  large companies to buy at attractive prices. Berkshire held $128 billion in cash or short-term Treasurys  as of Sept. 30, up from $122 billion at the end of the second quarter. Berkshire bought back about  $700 million of its own shares in the third quarter, bringing its total buybacks for the year to $2.8  billion, the company said. Berkshire reported third-quarter net earnings of $16.5 billion, or $10,119  per Class A share equivalent, from $18.5 billion, or $11,280 a share, in the year-earlier period. Net  earnings slipped 11% due to new accounting rules;  Berkshire has to report swings in its investment  portfolio in its net income figures. The unrealized gains during the third quarter were about $8 billion  compared to a gain of $10.2 billion in the same period a year earlier. Operating earnings, which  exclude some investment results, rose 14% to $7.9 billion from $6.9 billion in the year prior. Almost a  third of the jump in Berkshire?s third-quarter earnings came from finally recording its share of the  Kraft?s 2019 results. A $467 million gain replaced what had been blank spots in the past two quarters  as Kraft Heinz delayed reporting first-half results amid regulatory probes.  Berkshire?s BNSF railroad  overcame trade tensions, flooding and a slumping coal business to post a record profit in the quarter.  While volume dropped in all four of its main categories, the unit said it benefited from higher rates  and its ongoing efforts to rein in costs. A jump in property-casualty premiums at Berkshire?s  reinsurance drove that insurance?s  first underwriting profit in more than a year. That helped cushion  a 40% drop in Geico?s pretax underwriting earnings, which it attributed in part to higher severity in  auto claims. The reinsurance gain was in spite of $281 million in losses from Japan?s Typhoon Faxia,  and the company warned that last month?s Typhoon Hagibis will weigh on fourth-quarter results.

2019-11-11	aapl	Shares slipped in pre-market trading Monday amid a series of questions over the fairness of the algorithm linked to its Apple Titanium credit card and a potential investigation by financial services authorities in the state of New York. Apple, which launched Titanium earlier this year with Goldman Sachs GS, has been accused of allowing the card's algorithm to set credit limits for some applicants based on gender following a torrent of comments on Twitter over the weekend that included the voice of co-founder Steve Wozniak. The allegations prompted a response from Linda Lacewell, the Superintendent of New York State Department of Financial Services, who noted the so-called black box problem of opaque nature of credit scoring and the lack of consumer visibility in the process of correcting errors.

2019-10-31	aapl	The company projected fiscal first-quarter revenue that beat analysts? estimates, signaling solid demand for iPhone 11 models, new services like Apple TV+ and wearables such as upgraded AirPods and the Apple Watch. Fiscal first-quarter sales will be $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion, the company said. Analysts were looking for $86.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new forecast means Apple will return to growth, after missing sales targets in last year?s holiday period. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit also topped Wall Street estimates. Apple reported fourth-quarter sales of $64 billion, up 1.8% from a year earlier. Net income was $13.7 billion, or $3.03 a share, versus $14.1 billion, or $2.91 a share, in the same period last year. Analysts were looking for revenue of $63 billion and profit of $2.84 a share. The company said it sold $33.4 billion worth of iPhones in the quarter, beating analysts? estimates of $32.3 billion, but still down from $36.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. The Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats headphones, generated $6.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 54%, easily topping Wall Street estimates. The Services division is growing at a faster rate and revenue jumped 18% from a year earlier. Apple said it generated $7 billion in revenue from the Mac segment. That was down 5% and missed Wall Street expectations.

An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed the listings, and said the store would open in 2020.

2019-11-12	ba	Jumped yesterday after providing more detail on how the 737 Max will return to the skies -- even as the company backed away from earlier assurances that the grounded jet would win full regulatory approval by year-end. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is on track to certify redesigned flight-control software by mid-December, Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Monday in an email. That could enable the planemaker to begin shipping new jets that have been stashed across the Pacific Northwest and Texas during a flying ban imposed in March after two crashes killed 346 people. But the Max won?t be cleared to resume commercial flights until regulators also sign off on updated training material for pilots -- a step Boeing expects in January. And the company acknowledged it will take time for airlines to ready stored jets for service and work them back into flight schedules.
2019-11-11	ba	European regulators halted their in-depth antitrust probe into Boeing Co.?s plan to invest in Embraer SA, saying they hadn?t received sufficient information from the planemakers. The European Commission has been investigating the venture, warning that the deal could remove Embraer as the third-largest global competitor to both Boeing and Airbus SE, which ?may therefore result in higher prices and less choice.? The commission, one of the world?s toughest merger regulators, said Monday that it ?stopped the clock? and a review can only be restarted once it gets the answers it needs.

In a letter sent by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants to Muilenburg, the union reportedly said his appearance before Congress only raised more questions, and so the 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants refuse to board on the 737 Max without getting assurance on its safety from regulators first. The union also admitted their doubts about "whether the FAA has the resources necessary for oversight moving forward," reports said.

Analyst Nehal Chokshi forecast weakness in both unit sales and average selling prices, citing an analysis of a proprietary survey. The survey data ?lead us to expect 14% below consensus iPhone revenue in F2Q20 & 6% below for FY20,? the firm wrote to clients. It expects iPhone revenue will fall 5% in Apple?s fiscal 2020, and also anticipates that Apple?s operating profits will fall 2% year-over-year ?as ongoing growth in services and wearables will only partially offset iPhone declines.? Maxim established a $190 price target on the stock, which implies downside of nearly 30% from Apple?s Wednesday record close of $264.47.

Revenue in the fiscal second quarter will decline 3% to 5% from the same period a year earlier, consensus was for a 2.7% gain. That indicates sales of about $11.9 billion, compared with an average of analysts? estimates of $12.8 billion. Adjusted profit will be 75 cents to 77 cents a share, also missing analysts? estimates for 79 cents. For the just completed fiscal first-quarter net income fell to $2.93 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $3.55 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Revenue gained less than 1% to $13.2 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 84 cents a share, beating the 75 cent estimate. Cisco?s hardware business generated sales of $7.54 billion in the period ended Oct. 26, a drop of 1% from a year earlier. Applications, its software unit, gained 6% to $1.5 billion and security revenue jumped 22% to $815 million.

However, “the more we poke at our estimates, the harder it is for us to imagine they can be achieved.” The firm forecast weaknesses across AT&T’s businesses, with falling subscribers and video revenue at the company’s entertainment group, where it sees weakness persisting through 2022. It also noted falling ratings at Warner Media, where results are also expected to be diluted due to the upcoming launch of the HBO Max streaming-video service. Altogether, businesses representing 60% of AT&T’s total revenue “are likely to be down mid-singles,” in terms of growth, while Ebitda “is more likely than not to be down even more.” These trends will require AT&T’s wireless business “to do an awful lot of heavy lifting,” at a time when “all signs point to the wireless industry getting more competitive.”

2019-12-06	goog	More than 100,000 trips have been taken in robotaxis operated by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Alphabet Inc. Now the service is expanding to iPhone users. On the first anniversary of its pilot program in Chandler, Arizona, Waymo said it will begin offering an iOS app for its robot ride-hailing service for iPhones. It also revealed new details of the pioneering robotaxi service, which has been slow to offer fully autonomous service without human “safety drivers” behind the wheel to take over in an emergency. Since late summer, Waymo has ramped up a “rider only” option without human safety drivers to a test group of a few hundred commuters. While those people weren’t always charged initially, they are now paying rates that are competitive with Uber and Lyft ride-hailing services, according to a Waymo spokeswoman.
2019-12-06	intc	Qualcomm Inc. is under no illusions about how long it will take to make a dent in Intel Corp.’s dominance of the laptop market. But a new set of chips it’s offering will make it tougher to keep Qualcomm out of computers. Current models, such as Microsoft Corp.’s Surface Pro X, cost more than $1,000. Qualcomm is now rolling out new chips that will allow PC makers to build machines that compete with budget systems retailing for as low as $300. More affordable devices will help, but Qualcomm and other interlopers need new ways to reach consumers if they’re to overcome Intel’s brand recognition and marketing spending. One thing that’s helping is the sale of Qualcomm chip-based laptops by mobile phone service providers. Like phones, they’re increasingly being offered on monthly installment purchase plans, making the devices more affordable, Nunes said. Carriers like the cellular component of Qualcomm chips which ties customers to their networks, he said. Corporations like the idea that the machines they give to employees are always connected to the internet. Interest from that market has surprised Qualcomm. Knowing where the machines are and being able to update them all the time are advantages of a cellular link, Nunes said.

2019-12-06	uber	found more than 3,000 allegations of sexual assaults involving drivers or passengers on its platform in the U.S. last year, part of an extensive and long-awaited review in response to public safety concerns. The ride-hailing company released an 84-page safety report Thursday, seeking to quantify the misconduct and deaths that occur on its system and argue that its service is safer than alternatives. U.S. customers took about 1.3 billion trips last year, Uber said. About 50 people have died in Uber collisions annually for the past two years, at a rate about half the national average for automotive fatalities, according to the company. Nine people were killed in physical assaults last year, Uber said. Uber drivers reported nearly as many allegations of sexual assault as passengers, who made 56% of the claims. There is little comparable data on assaults in taxis or other transportation systems, and experts have said the attacks are widely under-reported.

In the securities fraud lawsuit, filed in October of last year, New York accused Exxon of lying to shareholders about its use of a “proxy cost” for carbon in accounting for future climate change regulation to make them think the company was being more prudent than it was.

Oracle (ORCL) reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 0.4%, the sixth consecutive quarter that sales have either declined or grown by less than 0.5% from the year before. Chief Executive Safra Catz said in a conference call that revenue is expected to grow 1% to 3% in the current quarter, but only when removing the effects of currency fluctuations.

2019-12-13	uber	The last time Uber lost its London license, recently appointed Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi jumped on a flight to the capital to apologize and “make things right” with city officials. This time around, he didn’t bother. Instead, he took to Twitter calling the decision “just wrong,” with London mayor Sadiq Khan firing back, branding Uber as “brash” and “aggressive” compared to the discussions last time. The ride-hailing app’s stand signals that it may take a different approach in its appeal, the deadline for which is Monday. Transport for London last month denied Uber a new license, saying the firm had failed to adequately verify drivers’ identities and safeguard the service for passengers. At least 14,000 trips involved drivers who weren’t who they said they were. Uber’s appeal could take years, and although it will be able to continue operating in the meantime, the decision puts its biggest market in Europe at risk. Uber’s fight to operate in the city will be tougher this time around because it will have to prove it’s not a repeat offender, according to lawyer Jolyon Maugham, who’s taken the company to court over its tax payments.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen declined Monday to order Uber to instantly convert drivers in its home state from contractors to employees based on an argument that it’s cheating not just workers but also the public at large. But the San Francisco judge also refused to throw out the case, an early test of a California law aimed at gig economy companies that’s set to take effect Jan. 1. In what may turn out to be a significant threat to Uber’s business model, Chen concluded the case presents “a plausible claim that any misclassification by Uber is willful.” Uber declined to comment on the ruling.

Commentators who found the film underwhelming pointed to a number of problems: It answered some of the same questions and themes of past movies, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.’s Nicholas Barber; it was dull, according to Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out; and Entertainment Weekly’s Darren Franich called it a “zombie.”

2019-12-26	uber	The news that Uber Inc. co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick is leaving the company's board effective Dec. 31 is a positive for the company, freeing its current management to strike their own path forward, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday. Kalanick, who was forced out of the ride-sharing company(UBER)in 2017 amid a scandal about its aggressive culture and reports he had ignored allegations of sexual harassment, has been steadily selling his roughly $3 billion in Uber shares since the lockup expiration freed him to do so, removing a major overhang, the analyst wrote in a note to clients. The entrepreneur has sold more than $2.5 billion of that total in recent weeks, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Given the pace of his insider sales and other initiatives he has on the horizon, it makes sense for Uber and Kalanick to go their separate ways at this time as it would be a distraction in our opinion if he remained in the Board room going forward," Ives wrote. "Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror as the overhang from the lockup has been a lingering cloud over the Uber name over the past few months."

2019-12-31	schw	was hit with an antitrust lawsuit in Manhattan federal court challenging its planned $26 billion acquisition of fellow financial advisory giant TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. The proposed deal would “transform” the $4 trillion wealth management industry, decimating smaller registered investment advisers (RIAs) that rely on Schwab and TD Ameritrade to serve as their “custodians,” according to the complaint. It would worsen concentration in a market that’s already dominated by just four advisories, including Schwab and TD Ameritrade, according to the complaint. “But the harm does not stop here,” the suit says. “The merger would also have a significant impact on innovation.” Schwab and TD Ameritrade currently “push each other to improve their current products, services, and technologies,” according to the complaint. Eliminating competition between them would allegedly slash the incentives that drive those improvements. Ordering TD Ameritrade’s custodial business sold to BlackCrown would “dissipate the anti-competitive effects” of the planned merger, the suit says.
2019-12-31	uber	Uber Technologies Inc. and Postmates Inc. sued the state of California, alleging that a labor rights law set to go into effect this week is unconstitutional. The lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles federal court is a preemptive strike against the state’s landmark measure designed to ensure gig workers receive employment protections. Uber and Postmates argue the legislative process around California’s Assembly Bill 5 unfairly targeted gig economy companies while favoring other industries and that the law will threaten workers’ flexibility. The passage of A.B. 5, which takes effect Wednesday, has set in motion a bitter dispute about the rights of Uber drivers, food couriers and other people who derive their income from apps made in Silicon Valley working as independent contractors. Uber and Postmates say it’s arbitrary that direct salespeople, travel agents, grant writers, construction truck drivers, commercial fishermen and others are exempted from the law. “There is no rhyme or reason to these nonsensical exemptions, and some are so ill-defined or entirely undefined that it is impossible to discern what they include or exclude,” according to the complaint. The impact of A.B. 5 -- and the backlash against it -- extends beyond the technology industry. Two organizations representing freelance journalists brought a legal challenge this month, saying the law restricts free speech and the news media by effectively limiting the number of articles a contract journalist can write for the same publication each year. The trucking industry, in its own lawsuit, says the measure would make it “impractical if not impossible” to use contractors for services across state lines. But tech companies have far more at stake financially if they are forced to provide overtime pay, health care and other benefits to the armies of contract laborers they rely on to drive customers around and deliver food. With their business models threatened, DoorDash Inc., Lyft Inc. and Uber have said they’ll spend a combined $90 million on a campaign asking California voters to overturn the law in the next election. Lyft and Uber have each committed to turning a profit by the end of 2021, a promise that could be unattainable if they’re forced to reclassify workers in their home state. The labor issue looms as a risk for Postmates as it heads toward a planned initial public offering. The food delivery company agreed to pay about $11.5 million to settle misclassification claims brought by couriers in California. Last month, a judge expressed “significant concerns” with the deal and sought more information. In Monday’s complaint, Uber, Postmates and one driver from each company who are also plaintiffs said they want a judge to block A.B. 5 from being implemented. They alleged that the law violates guarantees of equal protection afforded by both the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution. The companies take particular aim at the sponsor of the bill, Lorena Gonzalez, who they say has spoken forcefully about targeting gig-economy firms. In a November tweet, Gonzalez, a Democrat from San Diego, urged four of the state’s biggest cities to pursue court orders to enforce the law as soon as it takes effect. ”The one clear thing we know about Uber is they will do anything to try to exempt themselves from state regulations that make us all safer and their driver employees self-sufficient,” she said in response to Monday’s lawsuit. “In the meantime, Uber chief executives will continue to become billionaires while too many of their drivers are forced to sleep in their cars.”

The Round Rock, Texas-based computer maker said on Thursday it is releasing software that will let users mirror their iPhone’s screen on Dell laptops. The feature will roll out in coming months as an update to Dell’s Mobile Connect software, which added similar functionality for Android handsets in 2018. The update will also let Dell users drag photos, videos and other files from their iPhone to their PC. The software requires the download of an iPhone app and works with Dell XPS, Inspiron, Vostro and Alienware laptops running Windows 10.
2020-01-02	blk	“Investors should want to be where the money is flowing in asset management,” as the whole industry is likely to face persistent challenges, according to analysts at Wells Fargo. That means fresh overweight ratings for BlackRock Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, along with downgrades for Franklin Resources Inc., Invesco Ltd., Janus Henderson Group and Brightsphere Investment Group. “We have a preference for those companies that have demonstrated an ability to generate consistent net inflows,” Christopher Harris and others wrote in a note “realigning” ratings. “Certain long-established trends are likely to continue” -- including fee rate pressure and passive, retail distribution channel disruptions -- which will probably “present challenges for active managers over the long term,” he said.

The analyst believes that the stock is "fairly valued" in spite of its 11.3-times expected FY20 earnings multiple being below the 3-year average of 16-times and near the bottom of the 7- to- 30-times historical range.

Rosenblatt expects Disney+ will have 25 million subscribers at the end of Disney’s first fiscal quarter, up from a previous view of 21 million. For the full fiscal year, the firm sees 39 million subscribers, up from 35 million previously.
2020-01-02	wfc	Baird is starting 2020 with a warning note for bank investors as earnings growth and credit trends may disappoint, while optimism surrounding a trade deal is likely already baked into stock prices. Things are “getting weird out there,” analyst David George wrote in a banks outlook for the year. “With sentiment more bullish and valuations higher despite the later-cycle risks, we believe investors should avoid chasing stocks,” he said. Instead, he suggested trimming exposure “to the extent the market melt-up continues,” and downgraded Wells Fargo & Co. to underperform from neutral as part of that “more cautious industry view.” George said he likes new CEO Charlie Scharf, but his team “may initially lower expectations and provide an extended timetable for improving operating leverage.” George’s downgrade followed a warning last month from Cowen that the bank may face political trouble this year, with mounting risk as Democrats take aim. Odeon’s Dick Bove also cut Wells Fargo to sell last month, as the bank appeared “directionless,” even with its compelling consumer business.
2020-01-03	aapl	price target was raised by at least two analysts on Friday, with both citing optimism over iPhone sales in the holiday quarter. RBC Capital Markets raised its target to $330 from $295, while BofA boosted its own target to $330 from $290. Robert Muller, the RBC analyst, cited an analysis of social-media data for his view. The analysis “indicates higher customer interest and satisfaction with the current-year iPhone lineup, as well as sustained and increasing interest in Wearables,” a category that includes such products as AirPods or the Apple Watch. BofA expects the first quarter will be “strong” and noted healthy iPhone demand in recent months, along with third-party data that points to growth in App Store revenue. Over the longer term, wrote analyst Wamsi Mohan, Apple should benefit from 5G adoption, a “strong wearables portfolio” and “continued y/y gross profit dollar growth which is favorable for stock price trend.” He reiterated a buy rating on the stock.

2020-01-03	wfc	Downgrades in recent weeks have pushed analysts’ outlook on Wells Fargo & Co. to its bleakest since the financial crisis. Seven of the 31 analysts tracked by Bloomberg now have a sell rating or its equivalent on the firm, which is still reeling from scandals that erupted more than three years ago. That’s the highest proportion of sell ratings on Wells Fargo in more than a decade, and the bank hasn’t had so few buy ratings in at least 15 years. Investors have been keen for information on new Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf’s strategy since he joined in October, and some analysts are maintaining caution. Baird’s David George downgraded the shares Thursday, citing the potential for Scharf to “lower expectations.”

While Boeing had about $20 billion in available funds at the end of the third quarter, costs stemming from the Max crisis are increasing, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. That has prompted the company to consider raising additional debt, the paper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Analysts expect Boeing to raise as much as $5 billion in extra debt to help cover spending that may exceed $15 billion in the first half, the Journal said. Funds would help maintain Max production facilities and finished planes, as well as close the $4 billion purchase of an 80% stake in the airliner business of Embraer SA.

2020-01-07	aapl	Susquehanna semiconductor analyst Mehdi Hosseini said his recent checks with suppliers indicate that Apple will split its 5G iPhone lineup into two launches. He predicts that Apple will offer slower 5G models using sub-6ghz technology in September. The faster mmWave 5G iPhones will come out in either December or January 2021. Sub-6ghz 5G offers download speeds marginally better than current 4G LTE networks, while mmWave 5G can provide speeds 10 times faster. MmWave, however, has shorter ranges than sub-6ghz, making the faster technology more applicable for use in cities. The delay for the faster models was due to Apple's decision to use internal antenna modules rather than parts from an outside vendor, the analyst said.

2020-01-07	goog	Google urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that the company’s use of Oracle Corp.’s software for the Android mobile operating system violated copyrights, in a case that may reshape legal protections for software code. Google, in a filing to the court dated Monday, largely repeats the search giant’s well-established arguments in a case that has been contested for almost a decade: That it was legal to use parts of Oracle’s Java programming language to help make Android communicate more easily with other software. A defeat, Google has argued, would restrict further innovation in the computing industry. Oracle, which acquired Java when it bought its original developer Sun Microsystems, argues that it’s owed at least $8.8 billion for Google’s use of the code without a license. Much of Google’s business success over the past decade came from its ability to place its search engine -- and advertisements -- on phones running Android, which account for roughly one of every four smartphones worldwide. The case is likely to have ramifications beyond Google and Oracle -- many tech companies and startups rely on using bits of code other companies develop or own when building new software. That’s the plea Google is making to the court.

2020-01-08	ba	The Boeing passenger plane which crashed in Iran was an earlier model of the 737 jet the company grounded last year following two major disasters in which 346 people were killed. On Wednesday, the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) 737-800 crashed minutes into its journey from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. According to Iranian state media citing a government official, the plane lost control due to a fire in one of its engines - an assessment Ukrainian officials initially agreed with but have since backed away from. Neither the airline nor the manufacturer have commented on the cause. Flight PS752 took off nearly an hour after it was scheduled, flying to the west and reaching almost 8,000ft before all flight tracking data abruptly ended, according to flight-tracking website FlightRadar24. UIA said the Boeing 737-800 NG (Next-Generation) was built in 2016, was delivered direct from Boeing and underwent its last scheduled maintenance on Monday.

2020-01-08	goog	Google said its digital assistant is used by more than 500 million people every month. Depending on your perspective, that’s either a win for Google, or a big miss. On the one hand, having the voice-controlled technology on over half a billion devices far outstrips main rival Amazon.com Inc., which said last year that more than 100 million gadgets had been sold with its Alexa digital assistant.  However, Google’s Android operating system runs on roughly 2.5 billion devices. That suggests the Google Assistant either isn’t available with some of these products, or that many people aren’t using the service. Either way, the numbers give a glimpse into the war between Google, Amazon, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. to get their voice-controlled digital assistants in front of as many people as possible.

Bristol-Myers Squibb will also independently conduct and fund a Phase 1/2 dose optimization and expansion study in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer with bempeg and nivolumab. Nektar is eligible to receive a $25.0 million milestone payment in connection with the registrational adjuvant melanoma trial, $25.0 million in connection with the registrational muscle-invasive bladder cancer trial and $75.0 million in a registrational first-line non-small-cell lung cancer trial, the companies said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  We believe the amendment to add studies will help alleviate some of the concern that surfaced when the manufacturing issues first arose and Bristol said that it was reviewing the studies that it was going to further commit.

While Daryanani thinks that the combined IBM/Red Hat is "well positioned to enable the shift to hybrid era for large enterprises," he worries that the company's December-quarter expectations might be too aggressive "given slower enterprise backdrop highlighted by IBM itself in addition to comments from peers such as Cisco, Dell, etc," even if the mainframe business offsets those challenges. Looking ahead, Daryanani said that the consensus revenue estimate for 2020 suggests 1% to 2% organic growth (excluding Red Hat), which he said is "optimistic versus peer commentary." He lowered his price target to $145 from $160.

2020-01-14	c	4Q adjusted EPS $1.90, estimate $1.83 (range $1.74 to $1.90), primarily driven by 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding and net income growth. Revenue rose 7% y/y, with strong results from both the Institutional Clients Group and Global Consumer Banking.  Revenue from fixed-income trading shot up 49% in the fourth quarter -- more than double the increase predicted by analysts -- after a slump that rattled the industry a year ago. The rebound, combined with surprisingly strong earnings from debt underwriting and consumer banking, pushed net revenue for the period to the highest since 2015. In the investment banking segment, the firm leaned on strengthening capital markets businesses -- particularly investment-grade underwriting -- to counter a drop in fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions. The segment’s biggest contributor, debt capital markets, boosted revenue 16% to $738 million.

2020-01-14	ilmn	announced a new sequencing system and a collaboration with drugmaker Roche Holding AG on Monday, a bid to accelerate waning growth for its genetic-analysis products. The shares fell as much as 6.8% after Chief Executive Officer Francis deSouza, speaking on stage at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said that 2020 sales would grow 9% to 11%, below the 12% growth forecast by analysts, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock partially recovered after deSouza detailed plans for the new sequencing system and the Roche agreement. DeSouza said the upcoming NextSeq 1000 and 2000 sequencing systems will be significant redesigns of the company’s existing next-generation sequencing machines. The new systems will help further reduce the cost of DNA sequencing and improve quality. Illumina’s biggest customers currently spend about $800 to sequence a whole genome, DeSouza said, and eventually the company hopes to drive that cost down to $100. The company also announced a 15-year, non-exclusive collaboration agreement with Switzerland’s Roche to expand the adoption of diagnostic DNA-sequencing tests for cancer.

2020-01-14	jpm	just posted the best year for any U.S. bank in history. Fueled by a rebound in trading, especially in fixed income, the company said profit jumped 21% in the fourth quarter, pushing annual earnings to a record $36.4 billion. The bank generated $4.95 billion in trading revenue in the quarter, a 56% increase that was better than analysts expected. That marked the best fourth quarter for the firm’s trading desks in more than a decade. Fourth-quarter fixed-income trading revenue came in $1 billion higher than analysts predicted as the bank benefited from an active final few weeks of the year and gains in securitized products and rates. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $8.52 billion, or $2.57 a share, from $7.07 billion, or $1.98, a year earlier. That beat the $2.36 average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The firm’s consumer-banking unit posted a 3% increase in revenue as investments to open up branches in new states started to yield returns. Net charge-offs surged 21% to $1.49 billion from $1.24 billion a year earlier. The bank generated $14.2 billion of net interest income, bringing the full-year metric to $57.2 billion, slightly below the bank’s guidance of $57.5 billion.

While BofA’s earning per share was above expectations, its net interest yield of 2.35% was in line, and net interest income fell by 3% from the prior year, as lower interest rates were partly offset by loan and deposit growth. The bank also said: Expenses rose “modestly to $13.2 billion as investments in the franchise continue.” Its efficiency ratio rose to 59% from the previous year’s 58%. Credit and debit card spending rose 6% on record holiday spending. “BofA delivered another good result with the strength of the U.S. consumer showing through,” Atlantic Equities analyst John Heagerty wrote. However, he added that “much of the beat relative to consensus came from the lower tax rate,” while operational net income was in line with his forecasts.
2020-01-15	dis	Legacy media companies are facing a rough outlook as streaming video, led by well-capitalized names like Walt Disney and Apple, extends its recent dominance over traditional players, Moffett Nathanson wrote on Wednesday. Over the coming years, “the media industry’s cash flow will look much worse due to the confluence of several irreversible factors,” including an acceleration in cord-cutting and more content moving to streaming services. Referring to streaming, analyst Michael Nathanson wrote that “the entry of Disney and Apple into this mix to join Amazon and Netflix fundamentally changes the landscape for legacy linear entertainment choices.” Sustaining over-the-top streaming services “requires deep pockets to build and market a steady stream of original content,” and also requires that investors “tolerate the high cash burn of these models.” As part of its call, MoffettNathanson raised its price target on Disney to $165 from $150, and its Fox target to $44 from $39; the firm has a buy rating on both. Fox is the firm’s top 2020 pick, as the current valuation doesn’t reflect “the upside from upcoming renewals and improving Television profitability.”

2020-01-15	goog	Google is upending the advertising world with its decision to “render obsolete” a key tool used by marketers for years to track would-be customers as they move around the web: It’s phasing out the cookie. On Tuesday the Alphabet Inc. unit said it would stop supporting third party cookies over the next two years. Cookies -- the bits of code that lodge in peoples’ browsers and follow them around the web -- allow advertisers to target people with ads for websites they previously visited, and keep track of which ads finally induced a purchase. Cookies have long been a core part of how the massive online ad industry operates. Criteo SA, a French marketing technology company that is particularly tied into the current system, dropped 16% on the news. Google’s decision ushers in a new reality for digital marketing, even though it’s not the only company with a similar stance. Apple Inc.’s Safari and Mozilla Corp.’s Firefox browsers already block third-party cookies, but because Google’s Chrome is used by the majority of internet users, the company’s decision represents a major industry shift.
