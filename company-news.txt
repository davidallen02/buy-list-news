2019-11-08	baba	Is moving ahead with plans to raise as much as $15 billion in a Hong Kong share sale, people with knowledge of the matter said, a major win for a city rocked by months of civil unrest. Alibaba's share sale, which could be the largest globally this year, will be a triumph for a Hong Kong stock exchange that lost many of China's brightest technology stars to U.S. rivals. The Chinese e-commerce giant had aimed to list as early as over the summer before pro-democracy protests rocked the financial hub, while trade tensions between Washington and Beijing clouded the market's outlook. On Thursday, the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs on each other's goods in phases as they work toward a deal. "They probably want to minimize the risk from a U.S. trade war," said Danny Law, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd. "It makes a lot of sense."

2019-11-01	baba	Posted a stronger-than-projected 40% surge in revenue, affirming the resilience of online consumer spending despite a rapidly cooling economy. It reported revenue of 119 billion yuan ($16.9 billion) in the September quarter, surpassing the 116.7 billion yuan average of analysts' estimates.  Alibaba reported a net income of 72.5 billion yuan, boosted by a one-time gain booked after it finalized the acquisition of a third of Ant Financial, the payments and fintech giant controlled by Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma. Revenue from the cloud division leapt 64% to 9.3 billion yuan. The results came just days ahead of Alibaba's most important event of the year, the Singles' Day shopping extravaganza on Nov. 11, which last year netted more than $30 billion of sales over 24 hours.
2019-10-31	bmy	Said that U.S. sales have stalled for Opdivo, the cancer drug that makes up the core of the company's growth. The drug is facing stiff competition from a rival therapy from Merck & Co. However, Bristol-Myers raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.25 to $4.35 a share, an increase of 5 cents from the outlook it provided in July, estimate $4.30 . Third-quarter sales were $6.01 billion, outpacing the $5.90 billion average of analysts' estimates.  U.S. sales of Opdivo declined by 5% in the quarter, compared with a year prior. The drop-off is a surprise for a promising new drug, since most pharmaceutical products enjoy periods of steady growth after being introduced. Overall revenue from the product was up 1% to $1.82 billion, thanks to sales overseas. More upbeat news came from Bristol-Myers' blood thinner Eliquis, which outperformed Wall Street estimates with a sales increase of 22% to $1.93 billion.  Bristol reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.07.
2019-11-04	brkb	The company's cash pile hit a record in the third quarter, as Warren Buffett continued his hunt for  large companies to buy at attractive prices. Berkshire held $128 billion in cash or short-term Treasurys  as of Sept. 30, up from $122 billion at the end of the second quarter. Berkshire bought back about  $700 million of its own shares in the third quarter, bringing its total buybacks for the year to $2.8  billion, the company said. Berkshire reported third-quarter net earnings of $16.5 billion, or $10,119  per Class A share equivalent, from $18.5 billion, or $11,280 a share, in the year-earlier period. Net  earnings slipped 11% due to new accounting rules;  Berkshire has to report swings in its investment  portfolio in its net income figures. The unrealized gains during the third quarter were about $8 billion  compared to a gain of $10.2 billion in the same period a year earlier. Operating earnings, which  exclude some investment results, rose 14% to $7.9 billion from $6.9 billion in the year prior. Almost a  third of the jump in Berkshire's third-quarter earnings came from finally recording its share of the  Kraft's 2019 results. A $467 million gain replaced what had been blank spots in the past two quarters  as Kraft Heinz delayed reporting first-half results amid regulatory probes.  Berkshire's BNSF railroad  overcame trade tensions, flooding and a slumping coal business to post a record profit in the quarter.  While volume dropped in all four of its main categories, the unit said it benefited from higher rates  and its ongoing efforts to rein in costs. A jump in property-casualty premiums at Berkshire's  reinsurance drove that insurance's  first underwriting profit in more than a year. That helped cushion  a 40% drop in Geico's pretax underwriting earnings, which it attributed in part to higher severity in  auto claims. The reinsurance gain was in spite of $281 million in losses from Japan's Typhoon Faxia,  and the company warned that last month's Typhoon Hagibis will weigh on fourth-quarter results.

Under the new program, called Haven Healthcare, the bank's workers in Ohio and Arizona are being offered two plans for 2020 run by Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc., according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The bank employs about 30,000 people in the two states. JPMorgan, Amazon and Berkshire founded Boston-based Haven in 2018 with the goal of overhauling their health-care benefits, improving workers' health and lowering costs, but details about the effort have been scant.

2019-11-11	aapl	Shares slipped in pre-market trading Monday amid a series of questions over the fairness of the algorithm linked to its Apple Titanium credit card and a potential investigation by financial services authorities in the state of New York. Apple, which launched Titanium earlier this year with Goldman Sachs GS, has been accused of allowing the card's algorithm to set credit limits for some applicants based on gender following a torrent of comments on Twitter over the weekend that included the voice of co-founder Steve Wozniak. The allegations prompted a response from Linda Lacewell, the Superintendent of New York State Department of Financial Services, who noted the so-called black box problem of opaque nature of credit scoring and the lack of consumer visibility in the process of correcting errors.

2019-10-31	aapl	The company projected fiscal first-quarter revenue that beat analysts' estimates, signaling solid demand for iPhone 11 models, new services like Apple TV+ and wearables such as upgraded AirPods and the Apple Watch. Fiscal first-quarter sales will be $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion, the company said. Analysts were looking for $86.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new forecast means Apple will return to growth, after missing sales targets in last year's holiday period. Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit also topped Wall Street estimates. Apple reported fourth-quarter sales of $64 billion, up 1.8% from a year earlier. Net income was $13.7 billion, or $3.03 a share, versus $14.1 billion, or $2.91 a share, in the same period last year. Analysts were looking for revenue of $63 billion and profit of $2.84 a share. The company said it sold $33.4 billion worth of iPhones in the quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $32.3 billion, but still down from $36.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. The Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and Beats headphones, generated $6.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 54%, easily topping Wall Street estimates. The Services division is growing at a faster rate and revenue jumped 18% from a year earlier. Apple said it generated $7 billion in revenue from the Mac segment. That was down 5% and missed Wall Street expectations.

An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed the listings, and said the store would open in 2020. The brand will be distinct from Whole Foods and will have a conventional checkout line, unlike the cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores, she said.

2019-11-12	ba	Jumped yesterday after providing more detail on how the 737 Max will return to the skies -- even as the company backed away from earlier assurances that the grounded jet would win full regulatory approval by year-end. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is on track to certify redesigned flight-control software by mid-December, Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Monday in an email. That could enable the planemaker to begin shipping new jets that have been stashed across the Pacific Northwest and Texas during a flying ban imposed in March after two crashes killed 346 people. But the Max won't be cleared to resume commercial flights until regulators also sign off on updated training material for pilots -- a step Boeing expects in January. And the company acknowledged it will take time for airlines to ready stored jets for service and work them back into flight schedules.
2019-11-11	ba	European regulators halted their in-depth antitrust probe into Boeing Co.'s plan to invest in Embraer SA, saying they hadn't received sufficient information from the planemakers. The European Commission has been investigating the venture, warning that the deal could remove Embraer as the third-largest global competitor to both Boeing and Airbus SE, which "may therefore result in higher prices and less choice." The commission, one of the world's toughest merger regulators, said Monday that it "stopped the clock" and a review can only be restarted once it gets the answers it needs.

In a letter sent by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants to Muilenburg, the union reportedly said his appearance before Congress only raised more questions, and so the 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants refuse to board on the 737 Max without getting assurance on its safety from regulators first. The union also admitted their doubts about "whether the FAA has the resources necessary for oversight moving forward," reports said.

2019-11-14	aapl	Received a rare bear call on Thursday, after the company was downgraded to sell from hold at Maxim Group, which cited the potential for lower iPhone revenue over the next year. Analyst Nehal Chokshi forecast weakness in both unit sales and average selling prices, citing an analysis of a proprietary survey. The survey data "lead us to expect 14% below consensus iPhone revenue in F2Q20 & 6% below for FY20," the firm wrote to clients. It expects iPhone revenue will fall 5% in Apple's fiscal 2020, and also anticipates that Apple's operating profits will fall 2% year-over-year "as ongoing growth in services and wearables will only partially offset iPhone declines." Maxim established a $190 price target on the stock, which implies downside of nearly 30% from Apple's Wednesday record close of $264.47. 
2019-11-14	csco	Gave a quarterly sales forecast that fell far short of projections, signaling that companies are postponing hardware purchases amid global political and economic uncertainty, including the China-U.S. trade standoff.  Revenue in the fiscal second quarter will decline 3% to 5% from the same period a year earlier, consensus was for a 2.7% gain. That indicates sales of about $11.9 billion, compared with an average of analysts' estimates of $12.8 billion. Adjusted profit will be 75 cents to 77 cents a share, also missing analysts' estimates for 79 cents. For the just completed fiscal first-quarter net income fell to $2.93 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $3.55 billion, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Revenue gained less than 1% to $13.2 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 84 cents a share, beating the 75 cent estimate. Cisco's hardware business generated sales of $7.54 billion in the period ended Oct. 26, a drop of 1% from a year earlier. Applications, its software unit, gained 6% to $1.5 billion and security revenue jumped 22% to $815 million.

However, “the more we poke at our estimates, the harder it is for us to imagine they can be achieved.” The firm forecast weaknesses across AT&T’s businesses, with falling subscribers and video revenue at the company’s entertainment group, where it sees weakness persisting through 2022. It also noted falling ratings at Warner Media, where results are also expected to be diluted due to the upcoming launch of the HBO Max streaming-video service. Altogether, businesses representing 60% of AT&T’s total revenue “are likely to be down mid-singles,” in terms of growth, while Ebitda “is more likely than not to be down even more.” These trends will require AT&T’s wireless business “to do an awful lot of heavy lifting,” at a time when “all signs point to the wireless industry getting more competitive.”

2019-12-06	goog	More than 100,000 trips have been taken in robotaxis operated by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Alphabet Inc. Now the service is expanding to iPhone users. On the first anniversary of its pilot program in Chandler, Arizona, Waymo said it will begin offering an iOS app for its robot ride-hailing service for iPhones. It also revealed new details of the pioneering robotaxi service, which has been slow to offer fully autonomous service without human “safety drivers” behind the wheel to take over in an emergency. Since late summer, Waymo has ramped up a “rider only” option without human safety drivers to a test group of a few hundred commuters. While those people weren’t always charged initially, they are now paying rates that are competitive with Uber and Lyft ride-hailing services, according to a Waymo spokeswoman.
2019-12-06	intc	Qualcomm Inc. is under no illusions about how long it will take to make a dent in Intel Corp.’s dominance of the laptop market. But a new set of chips it’s offering will make it tougher to keep Qualcomm out of computers. Current models, such as Microsoft Corp.’s Surface Pro X, cost more than $1,000. Qualcomm is now rolling out new chips that will allow PC makers to build machines that compete with budget systems retailing for as low as $300. More affordable devices will help, but Qualcomm and other interlopers need new ways to reach consumers if they’re to overcome Intel’s brand recognition and marketing spending. One thing that’s helping is the sale of Qualcomm chip-based laptops by mobile phone service providers. Like phones, they’re increasingly being offered on monthly installment purchase plans, making the devices more affordable, Nunes said. Carriers like the cellular component of Qualcomm chips which ties customers to their networks, he said. Corporations like the idea that the machines they give to employees are always connected to the internet. Interest from that market has surprised Qualcomm. Knowing where the machines are and being able to update them all the time are advantages of a cellular link, Nunes said.

2019-12-06	uber	found more than 3,000 allegations of sexual assaults involving drivers or passengers on its platform in the U.S. last year, part of an extensive and long-awaited review in response to public safety concerns. The ride-hailing company released an 84-page safety report Thursday, seeking to quantify the misconduct and deaths that occur on its system and argue that its service is safer than alternatives. U.S. customers took about 1.3 billion trips last year, Uber said. About 50 people have died in Uber collisions annually for the past two years, at a rate about half the national average for automotive fatalities, according to the company. Nine people were killed in physical assaults last year, Uber said. Uber drivers reported nearly as many allegations of sexual assault as passengers, who made 56% of the claims. There is little comparable data on assaults in taxis or other transportation systems, and experts have said the attacks are widely under-reported.

2019-12-13	uber	The last time Uber lost its London license, recently appointed Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi jumped on a flight to the capital to apologize and “make things right” with city officials. This time around, he didn’t bother. Instead, he took to Twitter calling the decision “just wrong,” with London mayor Sadiq Khan firing back, branding Uber as “brash” and “aggressive” compared to the discussions last time. The ride-hailing app’s stand signals that it may take a different approach in its appeal, the deadline for which is Monday. Transport for London last month denied Uber a new license, saying the firm had failed to adequately verify drivers’ identities and safeguard the service for passengers. At least 14,000 trips involved drivers who weren’t who they said they were. Uber’s appeal could take years, and although it will be able to continue operating in the meantime, the decision puts its biggest market in Europe at risk. Uber’s fight to operate in the city will be tougher this time around because it will have to prove it’s not a repeat offender, according to lawyer Jolyon Maugham, who’s taken the company to court over its tax payments.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen declined Monday to order Uber to instantly convert drivers in its home state from contractors to employees based on an argument that it’s cheating not just workers but also the public at large. But the San Francisco judge also refused to throw out the case, an early test of a California law aimed at gig economy companies that’s set to take effect Jan. 1. In what may turn out to be a significant threat to Uber’s business model, Chen concluded the case presents “a plausible claim that any misclassification by Uber is willful.” Uber declined to comment on the ruling.

Commentators who found the film underwhelming pointed to a number of problems: It answered some of the same questions and themes of past movies, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.’s Nicholas Barber; it was dull, according to Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out; and Entertainment Weekly’s Darren Franich called it a “zombie.”

2019-12-26	uber	The news that Uber Inc. co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick is leaving the company's board effective Dec. 31 is a positive for the company, freeing its current management to strike their own path forward, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday. Kalanick, who was forced out of the ride-sharing company(UBER)in 2017 amid a scandal about its aggressive culture and reports he had ignored allegations of sexual harassment, has been steadily selling his roughly $3 billion in Uber shares since the lockup expiration freed him to do so, removing a major overhang, the analyst wrote in a note to clients. The entrepreneur has sold more than $2.5 billion of that total in recent weeks, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Given the pace of his insider sales and other initiatives he has on the horizon, it makes sense for Uber and Kalanick to go their separate ways at this time as it would be a distraction in our opinion if he remained in the Board room going forward," Ives wrote. "Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror as the overhang from the lockup has been a lingering cloud over the Uber name over the past few months."

2019-12-31	schw	was hit with an antitrust lawsuit in Manhattan federal court challenging its planned $26 billion acquisition of fellow financial advisory giant TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. The proposed deal would “transform” the $4 trillion wealth management industry, decimating smaller registered investment advisers (RIAs) that rely on Schwab and TD Ameritrade to serve as their “custodians,” according to the complaint. It would worsen concentration in a market that’s already dominated by just four advisories, including Schwab and TD Ameritrade, according to the complaint. “But the harm does not stop here,” the suit says. “The merger would also have a significant impact on innovation.” Schwab and TD Ameritrade currently “push each other to improve their current products, services, and technologies,” according to the complaint. Eliminating competition between them would allegedly slash the incentives that drive those improvements. Ordering TD Ameritrade’s custodial business sold to BlackCrown would “dissipate the anti-competitive effects” of the planned merger, the suit says.
2019-12-31	uber	Uber Technologies Inc. and Postmates Inc. sued the state of California, alleging that a labor rights law set to go into effect this week is unconstitutional. The lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles federal court is a preemptive strike against the state’s landmark measure designed to ensure gig workers receive employment protections. Uber and Postmates argue the legislative process around California’s Assembly Bill 5 unfairly targeted gig economy companies while favoring other industries and that the law will threaten workers’ flexibility. The passage of A.B. 5, which takes effect Wednesday, has set in motion a bitter dispute about the rights of Uber drivers, food couriers and other people who derive their income from apps made in Silicon Valley working as independent contractors. Uber and Postmates say it’s arbitrary that direct salespeople, travel agents, grant writers, construction truck drivers, commercial fishermen and others are exempted from the law. “There is no rhyme or reason to these nonsensical exemptions, and some are so ill-defined or entirely undefined that it is impossible to discern what they include or exclude,” according to the complaint. The impact of A.B. 5 -- and the backlash against it -- extends beyond the technology industry. Two organizations representing freelance journalists brought a legal challenge this month, saying the law restricts free speech and the news media by effectively limiting the number of articles a contract journalist can write for the same publication each year. The trucking industry, in its own lawsuit, says the measure would make it “impractical if not impossible” to use contractors for services across state lines. But tech companies have far more at stake financially if they are forced to provide overtime pay, health care and other benefits to the armies of contract laborers they rely on to drive customers around and deliver food. With their business models threatened, DoorDash Inc., Lyft Inc. and Uber have said they’ll spend a combined $90 million on a campaign asking California voters to overturn the law in the next election. Lyft and Uber have each committed to turning a profit by the end of 2021, a promise that could be unattainable if they’re forced to reclassify workers in their home state. The labor issue looms as a risk for Postmates as it heads toward a planned initial public offering. The food delivery company agreed to pay about $11.5 million to settle misclassification claims brought by couriers in California. Last month, a judge expressed “significant concerns” with the deal and sought more information. In Monday’s complaint, Uber, Postmates and one driver from each company who are also plaintiffs said they want a judge to block A.B. 5 from being implemented. They alleged that the law violates guarantees of equal protection afforded by both the U.S. Constitution and the California Constitution. The companies take particular aim at the sponsor of the bill, Lorena Gonzalez, who they say has spoken forcefully about targeting gig-economy firms. In a November tweet, Gonzalez, a Democrat from San Diego, urged four of the state’s biggest cities to pursue court orders to enforce the law as soon as it takes effect. ”The one clear thing we know about Uber is they will do anything to try to exempt themselves from state regulations that make us all safer and their driver employees self-sufficient,” she said in response to Monday’s lawsuit. “In the meantime, Uber chief executives will continue to become billionaires while too many of their drivers are forced to sleep in their cars.”

The Round Rock, Texas-based computer maker said on Thursday it is releasing software that will let users mirror their iPhone’s screen on Dell laptops. The feature will roll out in coming months as an update to Dell’s Mobile Connect software, which added similar functionality for Android handsets in 2018. The update will also let Dell users drag photos, videos and other files from their iPhone to their PC. The software requires the download of an iPhone app and works with Dell XPS, Inspiron, Vostro and Alienware laptops running Windows 10.
2020-01-02	blk	“Investors should want to be where the money is flowing in asset management,” as the whole industry is likely to face persistent challenges, according to analysts at Wells Fargo. That means fresh overweight ratings for BlackRock Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, along with downgrades for Franklin Resources Inc., Invesco Ltd., Janus Henderson Group and Brightsphere Investment Group. “We have a preference for those companies that have demonstrated an ability to generate consistent net inflows,” Christopher Harris and others wrote in a note “realigning” ratings. “Certain long-established trends are likely to continue” -- including fee rate pressure and passive, retail distribution channel disruptions -- which will probably “present challenges for active managers over the long term,” he said.

The analyst believes that the stock is "fairly valued" in spite of its 11.3-times expected FY20 earnings multiple being below the 3-year average of 16-times and near the bottom of the 7- to- 30-times historical range.

Rosenblatt expects Disney+ will have 25 million subscribers at the end of Disney’s first fiscal quarter, up from a previous view of 21 million. For the full fiscal year, the firm sees 39 million subscribers, up from 35 million previously.
2020-01-02	wfc	Baird is starting 2020 with a warning note for bank investors as earnings growth and credit trends may disappoint, while optimism surrounding a trade deal is likely already baked into stock prices. Things are “getting weird out there,” analyst David George wrote in a banks outlook for the year. “With sentiment more bullish and valuations higher despite the later-cycle risks, we believe investors should avoid chasing stocks,” he said. Instead, he suggested trimming exposure “to the extent the market melt-up continues,” and downgraded Wells Fargo & Co. to underperform from neutral as part of that “more cautious industry view.” George said he likes new CEO Charlie Scharf, but his team “may initially lower expectations and provide an extended timetable for improving operating leverage.” George’s downgrade followed a warning last month from Cowen that the bank may face political trouble this year, with mounting risk as Democrats take aim. Odeon’s Dick Bove also cut Wells Fargo to sell last month, as the bank appeared “directionless,” even with its compelling consumer business.
2020-01-03	aapl	price target was raised by at least two analysts on Friday, with both citing optimism over iPhone sales in the holiday quarter. RBC Capital Markets raised its target to $330 from $295, while BofA boosted its own target to $330 from $290. Robert Muller, the RBC analyst, cited an analysis of social-media data for his view. The analysis “indicates higher customer interest and satisfaction with the current-year iPhone lineup, as well as sustained and increasing interest in Wearables,” a category that includes such products as AirPods or the Apple Watch. BofA expects the first quarter will be “strong” and noted healthy iPhone demand in recent months, along with third-party data that points to growth in App Store revenue. Over the longer term, wrote analyst Wamsi Mohan, Apple should benefit from 5G adoption, a “strong wearables portfolio” and “continued y/y gross profit dollar growth which is favorable for stock price trend.” He reiterated a buy rating on the stock.

2020-01-03	wfc	Downgrades in recent weeks have pushed analysts’ outlook on Wells Fargo & Co. to its bleakest since the financial crisis. Seven of the 31 analysts tracked by Bloomberg now have a sell rating or its equivalent on the firm, which is still reeling from scandals that erupted more than three years ago. That’s the highest proportion of sell ratings on Wells Fargo in more than a decade, and the bank hasn’t had so few buy ratings in at least 15 years. Investors have been keen for information on new Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf’s strategy since he joined in October, and some analysts are maintaining caution. Baird’s David George downgraded the shares Thursday, citing the potential for Scharf to “lower expectations.”

While Boeing had about $20 billion in available funds at the end of the third quarter, costs stemming from the Max crisis are increasing, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. That has prompted the company to consider raising additional debt, the paper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Analysts expect Boeing to raise as much as $5 billion in extra debt to help cover spending that may exceed $15 billion in the first half, the Journal said. Funds would help maintain Max production facilities and finished planes, as well as close the $4 billion purchase of an 80% stake in the airliner business of Embraer SA.

2020-01-07	aapl	Susquehanna semiconductor analyst Mehdi Hosseini said his recent checks with suppliers indicate that Apple will split its 5G iPhone lineup into two launches. He predicts that Apple will offer slower 5G models using sub-6ghz technology in September. The faster mmWave 5G iPhones will come out in either December or January 2021. Sub-6ghz 5G offers download speeds marginally better than current 4G LTE networks, while mmWave 5G can provide speeds 10 times faster. MmWave, however, has shorter ranges than sub-6ghz, making the faster technology more applicable for use in cities. The delay for the faster models was due to Apple's decision to use internal antenna modules rather than parts from an outside vendor, the analyst said.

2020-01-07	goog	Google urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that the company’s use of Oracle Corp.’s software for the Android mobile operating system violated copyrights, in a case that may reshape legal protections for software code. Google, in a filing to the court dated Monday, largely repeats the search giant’s well-established arguments in a case that has been contested for almost a decade: That it was legal to use parts of Oracle’s Java programming language to help make Android communicate more easily with other software. A defeat, Google has argued, would restrict further innovation in the computing industry. Oracle, which acquired Java when it bought its original developer Sun Microsystems, argues that it’s owed at least $8.8 billion for Google’s use of the code without a license. Much of Google’s business success over the past decade came from its ability to place its search engine -- and advertisements -- on phones running Android, which account for roughly one of every four smartphones worldwide. The case is likely to have ramifications beyond Google and Oracle -- many tech companies and startups rely on using bits of code other companies develop or own when building new software. That’s the plea Google is making to the court.

2020-01-08	ba	The Boeing passenger plane which crashed in Iran was an earlier model of the 737 jet the company grounded last year following two major disasters in which 346 people were killed. On Wednesday, the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) 737-800 crashed minutes into its journey from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. According to Iranian state media citing a government official, the plane lost control due to a fire in one of its engines - an assessment Ukrainian officials initially agreed with but have since backed away from. Neither the airline nor the manufacturer have commented on the cause. Flight PS752 took off nearly an hour after it was scheduled, flying to the west and reaching almost 8,000ft before all flight tracking data abruptly ended, according to flight-tracking website FlightRadar24. UIA said the Boeing 737-800 NG (Next-Generation) was built in 2016, was delivered direct from Boeing and underwent its last scheduled maintenance on Monday.

2020-01-08	goog	Google said its digital assistant is used by more than 500 million people every month. Depending on your perspective, that’s either a win for Google, or a big miss. On the one hand, having the voice-controlled technology on over half a billion devices far outstrips main rival Amazon.com Inc., which said last year that more than 100 million gadgets had been sold with its Alexa digital assistant.  However, Google’s Android operating system runs on roughly 2.5 billion devices. That suggests the Google Assistant either isn’t available with some of these products, or that many people aren’t using the service. Either way, the numbers give a glimpse into the war between Google, Amazon, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. to get their voice-controlled digital assistants in front of as many people as possible.

Bristol-Myers Squibb will also independently conduct and fund a Phase 1/2 dose optimization and expansion study in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer with bempeg and nivolumab. Nektar is eligible to receive a $25.0 million milestone payment in connection with the registrational adjuvant melanoma trial, $25.0 million in connection with the registrational muscle-invasive bladder cancer trial and $75.0 million in a registrational first-line non-small-cell lung cancer trial, the companies said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  We believe the amendment to add studies will help alleviate some of the concern that surfaced when the manufacturing issues first arose and Bristol said that it was reviewing the studies that it was going to further commit.

2020-01-14	c	4Q adjusted EPS $1.90, estimate $1.83 (range $1.74 to $1.90), primarily driven by 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding and net income growth. Revenue rose 7% y/y, with strong results from both the Institutional Clients Group and Global Consumer Banking.  Revenue from fixed-income trading shot up 49% in the fourth quarter -- more than double the increase predicted by analysts -- after a slump that rattled the industry a year ago. The rebound, combined with surprisingly strong earnings from debt underwriting and consumer banking, pushed net revenue for the period to the highest since 2015. In the investment banking segment, the firm leaned on strengthening capital markets businesses -- particularly investment-grade underwriting -- to counter a drop in fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions. The segment’s biggest contributor, debt capital markets, boosted revenue 16% to $738 million.

2020-01-14	ilmn	announced a new sequencing system and a collaboration with drugmaker Roche Holding AG on Monday, a bid to accelerate waning growth for its genetic-analysis products. The shares fell as much as 6.8% after Chief Executive Officer Francis deSouza, speaking on stage at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, said that 2020 sales would grow 9% to 11%, below the 12% growth forecast by analysts, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock partially recovered after deSouza detailed plans for the new sequencing system and the Roche agreement. DeSouza said the upcoming NextSeq 1000 and 2000 sequencing systems will be significant redesigns of the company’s existing next-generation sequencing machines. The new systems will help further reduce the cost of DNA sequencing and improve quality. Illumina’s biggest customers currently spend about $800 to sequence a whole genome, DeSouza said, and eventually the company hopes to drive that cost down to $100. The company also announced a 15-year, non-exclusive collaboration agreement with Switzerland’s Roche to expand the adoption of diagnostic DNA-sequencing tests for cancer.

2020-01-14	jpm	just posted the best year for any U.S. bank in history. Fueled by a rebound in trading, especially in fixed income, the company said profit jumped 21% in the fourth quarter, pushing annual earnings to a record $36.4 billion. The bank generated $4.95 billion in trading revenue in the quarter, a 56% increase that was better than analysts expected. That marked the best fourth quarter for the firm’s trading desks in more than a decade. Fourth-quarter fixed-income trading revenue came in $1 billion higher than analysts predicted as the bank benefited from an active final few weeks of the year and gains in securitized products and rates. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $8.52 billion, or $2.57 a share, from $7.07 billion, or $1.98, a year earlier. That beat the $2.36 average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The firm’s consumer-banking unit posted a 3% increase in revenue as investments to open up branches in new states started to yield returns. Net charge-offs surged 21% to $1.49 billion from $1.24 billion a year earlier. The bank generated $14.2 billion of net interest income, bringing the full-year metric to $57.2 billion, slightly below the bank’s guidance of $57.5 billion.

While BofA’s earning per share was above expectations, its net interest yield of 2.35% was in line, and net interest income fell by 3% from the prior year, as lower interest rates were partly offset by loan and deposit growth. The bank also said: Expenses rose “modestly to $13.2 billion as investments in the franchise continue.” Its efficiency ratio rose to 59% from the previous year’s 58%. Credit and debit card spending rose 6% on record holiday spending. “BofA delivered another good result with the strength of the U.S. consumer showing through,” Atlantic Equities analyst John Heagerty wrote. However, he added that “much of the beat relative to consensus came from the lower tax rate,” while operational net income was in line with his forecasts.
2020-01-15	dis	Legacy media companies are facing a rough outlook as streaming video, led by well-capitalized names like Walt Disney and Apple, extends its recent dominance over traditional players, Moffett Nathanson wrote on Wednesday. Over the coming years, “the media industry’s cash flow will look much worse due to the confluence of several irreversible factors,” including an acceleration in cord-cutting and more content moving to streaming services. Referring to streaming, analyst Michael Nathanson wrote that “the entry of Disney and Apple into this mix to join Amazon and Netflix fundamentally changes the landscape for legacy linear entertainment choices.” Sustaining over-the-top streaming services “requires deep pockets to build and market a steady stream of original content,” and also requires that investors “tolerate the high cash burn of these models.” As part of its call, MoffettNathanson raised its price target on Disney to $165 from $150, and its Fox target to $44 from $39; the firm has a buy rating on both. Fox is the firm’s top 2020 pick, as the current valuation doesn’t reflect “the upside from upcoming renewals and improving Television profitability.”

2020-01-15	goog	Google is upending the advertising world with its decision to “render obsolete” a key tool used by marketers for years to track would-be customers as they move around the web: It’s phasing out the cookie. On Tuesday the Alphabet Inc. unit said it would stop supporting third party cookies over the next two years. Cookies -- the bits of code that lodge in peoples’ browsers and follow them around the web -- allow advertisers to target people with ads for websites they previously visited, and keep track of which ads finally induced a purchase. Cookies have long been a core part of how the massive online ad industry operates. Criteo SA, a French marketing technology company that is particularly tied into the current system, dropped 16% on the news. Google’s decision ushers in a new reality for digital marketing, even though it’s not the only company with a similar stance. Apple Inc.’s Safari and Mozilla Corp.’s Firefox browsers already block third-party cookies, but because Google’s Chrome is used by the majority of internet users, the company’s decision represents a major industry shift.

2020-01-22	ba	The latest chapter in Boeing Co.’s 737 Max saga came on Tuesday when the plane maker said the grounded jet won’t fly again until the middle of this year, surprising Wall Street analysts and sending shares lower. Boeing dropped as much as 5.7% on Tuesday, and finally closed down 3.3%. The stock is now down 26% since the second fatal crash of the 737 Max last March, only five months after the first disaster, which ultimately led to the jet’s grounding. “We were surprised by Boeing’s statement because it pushes back the certification date at a time when we saw the process as moving forward,” Sanford C Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned wrote in a note. The analyst said it was also unclear what led to the change in timing, and if it was due to new information from the Federal Aviation Administration or new issues that Boeing found. “Our understanding is that Boeing saw the need to give customers and suppliers a rough picture of timing,” Harned said.  The prolonged grounding of the 737 Max has led Boeing to halt production of the aircraft, a move that’s reverberating through its supply chain and is even leaching into the entire U.S. economy’s performance. Shares of Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing’s top supplier, have fallen 33% since the March crash. “While Boeing had not previously provided specific guidance for the timing of the ungrounding, consensus estimates were that the return to service for the Max would start in early second quarter of 2020,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said. The 3-month delay is “incrementally negative for Boeing and the 737 Max supply chain,” the analyst added. He expects more detail when Boeing reports fourth-quarter results next week.

Group revenues, however, rose only 4.35% to $18.2 billion, missing analysts' estimates of an $18.4 billion tally. Organic sales, which exclude items like acquisitions and currency fluctuations, rose 5% in the company’s fiscal second quarter, short of the average of analysts’ projections for growth of 5.6%.  P&G’s steps to boost growth while keeping costs under control seem to have largely worked. The results indicate that strength from the past two quarters is largely holding. P&G’s beauty business once again outperformed other segments, with organic sales growth of 8%, matching estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The grooming business posted growth of 4%, slightly outpacing expectations. Baby, feminine and family care fell short of analyst expectations, with organic sales rising just 1%, the weakest growth among the company’s business units.

For the first quarter, the company reported $91.8 billion in revenue, up 9% from a year earlier. Wall Street was looking for $88.4 billion. Profit was $4.99 a share, also beating analysts’ expectations.  For the fiscal second quarter, Apple said sales will be between $63 billion and $67 billion. Analysts estimated $62.3 billion, on average. Apple generated $56 billion in revenue from the iPhone in the fiscal first quarter, up 8% from a year earlier. That was a lot better than the 2018 holiday period, when sales of the handset dropped about 15%. Apple cut the price of its entry-level flagship iPhone by $50, luring buyers. There are also millions of older iPhones that are losing software support from the company, spurring new purchases. Wearables, including AirPods, and other accessories generated $10 billion in revenue in the holiday quarter, up 37% from a year ago. The company reported Services revenue of $12.7 billion, up 17% from the same period last year. That missed analysts’ forecasts. This business still mostly relies on older offerings such as the App Store, iCloud storage and Apple Music.

2020-01-29	ba	Lost $2.33 a share from $17.9 billion in sales. Last year, before the MAX was grounded, Boeing earned $5.48 a share from $28.3 billion in fourth-quarter sales. The $10.4 billion quarterly sales gap is almost entirely due to the MAX. The fourth-quarter numbers included another $2.6 billion charge for customer compensation. In 2019, Boeing set aside $5 billion for payments to airlines who buy its jets, and have lost money as a result of the grounding. Full-year free cash flow at Boeing was negative $4.3 billion. That's not great, but inventories rose about $14 billion last year. Boeing spent a lot of money building and parking about 400 MAX jets.

2020-01-29	ge	Soared after the company said cash from its manufacturing operations will probably rise in 2020, buoying Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp’s effort to rescue the iconic maker of jet engines and power equipment. Industrial free cash flow, a closely watched metric that’s viewed as an indicator of earnings potential, is projected to climb to as much as $4 billion this year from $2.32 billion in 2019, GE said in a statement Wednesday. Wall Street had been expecting $2.2 billion for this year. GE generated free cash flow from its industrial businesses of $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter. The 2019 annual figure of $2.32 billion topped the $1.3 billion expected by analysts and GE’s own forecast. Early last year, GE had predicted burning as much as $2 billion, before raising the forecast several times. The company also beat profit expectations. Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings rose to 21 cents a share, GE said, above the 17-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 1% to $26.2 billion, while Wall Street anticipated $25.3 billion.

2020-01-29	sbux	Has closed more than 2,000 locations in mainland China because of a viral outbreak that has killed more than 100 people and disrupted daily life in the coffee chain’s most important growth market. The news cast gloom over what otherwise would have been an upbeat earnings report. Same-store sales, an important gauge of success for restaurant chains, rose 5% in the fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 29, outpacing the 4.6% average estimate compiled by Consensus Metrix. The company maintained its 2020 forecast but said it doesn’t include the impact of temporarily closing so many stores because it can’t yet calculate it. Adjusted EPS rose to $0.79 in Q1 from $0.75 a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $0.76 in a Capital IQ poll. Revenue grew 7% to $7.1 billion from a year ago, broadly in-line with market expectations.

Under the agreement, Spirit will restart production slowly, ramping up deliveries throughout the year to reach a total of 216 MAX shipsets delivered to Boeing in 2020. Spirit does not expect to achieve a production rate of 52 shipsets per month until late 2022. The parties are continuing to negotiate other terms.

As previously disclosed, the 737 MAX contractual agreement is a requirements contract between Boeing and Spirit and the rate may change at any time.
2020-01-30	amzn	As Amazon.com Inc. prepares to report quarterly results on Thursday afternoon, some analysts warn that slowing growth and rising costs at the company’s most profitable division may ding earnings. Amazon Web Services, the biggest seller of rented computer processing power and data storage, has accounted for two-thirds of its parent company’s operating income during the last three years. That windfall gave Amazon a cash cushion to continue to make big bets in other areas. A consistently profitable AWS also gave investors confidence that the Seattle-based company had turned a corner despite occasional struggles to make money from the core e-commerce business. But amid intensifying competition from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, the AWS cash machine has been slowing down. In the third quarter, the cloud services division posted the weakest year-over-year revenue growth since Amazon began breaking out AWS’s revenue in 2015 -- a trend some analysts believe continued in the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31. AWS is spending heavily on new data centers and hiring thousands of salespeople and engineers to pitch services to potential customers. Meanwhile, Amazon has been pouring resources into next-day deliveries. So despite expectations for robust e-commerce sales during the holiday shopping period, operating profit is expected to fall about 27% to $2.75 billion. “Investments in shipping and AWS will limit near-term profitability,” Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Scott Devitt wrote in a recent note to clients.

Analyst John Hodulik added that “competition in wireless is intensifying,” and that it should “kick into a new gear” in the second half of the year. The firm trimmed its price target to $39 from $42; the risk profile looks “generally balanced” at current levels.
2020-01-30	ctva	Is accelerating the ramp-up of its proprietary genetically engineered seeds in North America over the next five years as it reduces volume of Bayer-licensed Roundup products, it said in a statement Thursday. The company, previously the agriculture division of DowDuPont, sees strong demand for the technology and now expects planted acreage projections in 2020 to approach 20% of the U.S. market, double original expectations. The number of licensee agreements have risen to more than 120 in the U.S. and Canada. Corteva received import authorization in China for the Conkesta soybean insect control trait, which will be offered as a stack with Enlist E3 soybean herbicide in Latin America in the early 2020s. In the fourth quarter, the company reported a 6% increase in net sales from the same period last year and about $50 million in merger-related synergies; it posted a 6-cent per share loss from continuing operations. This year, it expects net sales of about $14.5 billion, operating EBITDA of $2.2 billion; its operating EPS range is between $1.45 and $1.55 a share
2020-01-30	fcx	Shares are on the cusp of a bear market as the world's largest copper producer warned about plunging copper prices on concerns coronavirus has severely impacted China's economy, reported Reuters. Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in an interview on Tuesday that the outbreak of coronavirus in China is a "real black swan event" for the global economy. China is the largest buyer of the industrial metal in the world, and with large swaths of its industrial sector shut down because of the virus and holiday, demand has collapsed, sending prices lower for the past ten sessions, the longest losing streak since 1986. Back in 2003, the SARS outbreak led to a 10% decline of Goldman Sachs Commodity Price index and fully recovered months later. Adkerson's warning of a "black swan" event for the global economy is because China is one of the largest drivers of growth in the world. If, for whatever reason, their industries or consumers go offline, it would create a massive shock that could tilt the global economy into recession.

No final decision has been made, and GE could decide to retain the asset, the people said. A sale would mark a major step in Culp’s effort to reshape the power business that was at the heart of GE’s troubles in recent years. GE Power, which also makes gas turbines and generators, has been a cash drain amid waning demand for new power plants.

Shares fell as much as 1.8% pre-market. The disclosure Tuesday evening that more than half of the coffee retailers approximate 4,300 stores in China have been temporarily closed is “more concerning than expected,” he said On the call, management was “pressed multiple times” for greater detail on potential impact of the closures on financials, “quite understandably,” they had “very little detail to provide.” Farmer sees an “unfavorable near-term risk/reward” for shares even though management “repeatedly stressed” that SBUX was in a position to boost guidance prior to virus headwind and that the China comp. sales headwind is temporary. The coronavirus headlines are “still building” and Wall Street is “struggling to understand” the impact of the virus on the SBUX business model, he said.

2020-01-31	cvx	Swung to a loss in the fourth quarter on asset-impairment charges and reported lower revenue, though it beat adjusted-earnings expectations. The company posted a net loss of $6.61 billion, or $3.51 a share, compared with earnings of $3.73 billion, or $1.95 a share, in the comparable quarter last year. The company attributed the loss to upstream impairments and writeoffs of $10.4 billion related to Appalachia shale, Kitimat LNG, Big Foot and other projects. Excluding special items and the effect of foreign exchange, earnings were $1.49 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.47 a share. Revenue fell to $36.35 billion from $42.35 billion the same period last year. Analysts were looking for $38.96 billion. The company said its average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $47 for the quarter, down from $56 a year earlier.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted earnings of 73 cents a share on $3.93 billion in revenue. Organic revenue +5% vs. +2% y/y.  The company said it expects 4% to 6% net sales growth in 2020, or 3% to 5% on an organic basis. In 2019, net sales rose 1% from 2018, or 4% on an organic basis. The company also guided for a mid to high-single-digit increase in earnings per share and low to mid-single-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share.
2020-01-31	xom	Profit slid more than 5% in the fourth quarter, though the country's biggest oil producer put up some strong revenue numbers. Exxon Mobil earned $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the period, down from $6 billion, or $1.41 per share, last year. The current quarter included favorable items of 92 cents per share, which was mostly related to a $3.7 billion gain related to the Norway sale. Removing the asset sale, per-share profit was 41 cents, shy of the 44 cents analysts were looking for. Revenue reached $67.17 billion. Oil-equivalent production was in line with a year ago, at 4 million barrels per day. A 4% increase in liquids was offset by a 5% decrease in gas. Exxon’s $35 billion-a-year rebuild of its upstream portfolio is swallowing up so much cash that the company is unable to consistently pay dividends from cash flow, leaning heavily on asset sales and borrowing to fund the payout. The supermajor’s fourth-quarter capital spending exceeded analysts’ estimates by 36%, demonstrating Exxon’s commitment to a raft of new oil and natural gas investments. Perhaps more ominous for Exxon is that the Permian Basin that was seen as one of the company’s future profit engines is showing signs of trouble. The company’s oil output in the region continued to grow in the four quarter, but at a slower pace than before. Meanwhile, its Permian gas output dropped.

Revenue of $6.05 billion was a hair shy of the FactSet consensus projection for $6.08 billion. The company disclosed that payment volume grew by 8%, or 10% excluding China and the U.K. Management said China volumes are mainly related to dual-branded cards that don't have much revenue impact. First quarter cross-border volumes rose at constant currency 9%, estimate 8.55%.  Total Visa processed transactions +11%, estimate +11.3%, while total Visa processed transactions $37.8 billion, +12% y/y.  First quarter payments volume at constant currency 8%, estimate 8.83%.

Visa last year renewed its longtime partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co., and has been spending more on rebates designed to encourage banks and retailers to route transactions over its network. Those incentives added up to $1.75 billion in the first quarter, a jump of 20%.

Guyana had a strong bargaining position when the contract came up for renegotiation in 2016 because Exxon had just made a giant offshore oil discovery, but “inexperienced” bureaucrats failed to press for substantially better fiscal terms, Global Witness said in a report titled “Signed Away” on Monday. Government officials were more concerned with a maritime border dispute with Venezuela than negotiating better terms, the group said. Natural Resources Minister Raphael Trotman signed an “exceptionally bad” deal compared with other frontier oil nations, Global Witness said, citing a fiscal analysis by OpenOil, a Berlin-based public-policy researcher.

Adjusted earnings declined from $1.84 a share a year ago and revenue increased from $15.3 billion, and the results beat average analyst expectations of adjusted earnings of $1.46 a share on sales of $20.76 billion.  Disney+ is part of one of Disney's smallest segments, which combines its direct-to-consumer efforts and international media units and reported quarterly revenue of $3.99 billion. It is the only money-losing segment for Disney, reporting an operating loss of $693 million. Analysts on average were expecting an operating loss of $802 million on revenue of $3.85 billion. Disney+ seemed to help Disney's other streaming efforts, boosting that segment. Disney said that the ESPN+ streaming service had 6.6 million subscribers, nearly double the 3.5 million that Iger disclosed just three months ago. Hulu topped 30 million paying subscribers, at 30.4 million, and Iger said three months ago that total was 28.5 million. Disney reported operating profit of $2.34 billion on revenue of $7.4 billion from its theme-parks business, beating average analyst expectations for profit of $2.32 billion on revenue of $7.32 billion. In the TV-networks business, Disney reported operating profit of $1.63 billion on revenue of $7.36 billion, beating average analyst expectations for operating income of $1.53 billion on sales of $6.93 billion. The company's movie-studio business, which is seeing the most effect from the addition of what is now referred to as 20th Century Studios, reported operating income of $948 million on revenue of $3.76 billion from a quarter in which it launched two movies that have brought in more than $1 billion in box-office receipts world-wide, "Frozen 2" and "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." Analysts on average expected operating income of $924 million on revenue of $3.41 billion, according to FactSet.

Revenue was $5.9 billion, up 1.4% from a year earlier and higher than the $5.71 billion analysts had been expecting. Affecting the quarter were sales of some of the company's top-selling drugs, including its HIV medications, which came in at $4.6 billion vs. $4.1 billion a year ago, and sales of its hepatitis C treatments, which fell to $630 million from $738 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

2020-02-05	mrk	Posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings Wednesday and unveiled plans to spinoff its women's healthcare business. Merck said adjusted earnings for the three months ending in December were pegged at $1.16 per share, up 11.5% from the same period last year and one penny ahead of the Street consensus forecast. Worldwide sales, Merck said, rose 8% to $11.9 billion, just shy of analysts' forecasts of an $11.98 billion tally. Merck also said it will spinoff its women's healthcare division into a separate company as it focuses on "growth pillars" in oncology, vaccines and hospital and animal health. Merck said the deal will create $1.5 billion in operational efficiencies by 2024, while creating a new organization -- which will also include biosimilar drugs and legacy products -- with revenues of $6.5 billion a year. Merck said sales of its key cancer treatment, Keytruda, rose 44.65% from last year to $3.11 billion, although that is a slower growth rate than the 65% pace recorded over the same period in 2018. Looking into 2020, Merck said it sees non-GAAP earnings in the region of $5.62 to $5.77 per share, and full-year worldwide sales of between $48.8 billion and $50.3 billion (consensus is for $5.67 in earnings on revenue totaling $49.43 billion).

2020-02-06	blk	Scolded Siemens AG for its handling of a controversial rail contract for an Australian coal mine, piling pressure on the German industrial company from its biggest shareholder over the order. While Siemens “followed its internal review process” on the contract, the media and activist attention around it means the company needs a “more thorough review of the potential risks,” BlackRock said in its voting bulletin for Siemens’s shareholder meeting Wednesday. “We are reassured by the company’s acknowledgment that it intends to do this,” said the investment manager. BlackRock holds a 5.4% stake in Siemens, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and approved all items on the agenda. Siemens’s contract to supply rail signaling equipment to Adani Power Ltd. for its Carmichael coal mine in Queensland, Australia has come under intense criticism from environmental activists.

Global sales of Opdivo declined by about 2% in the quarter, as Bristol-Myers faces off in a heated rivalry against Merck & Co. and its competing drug Keytruda.

2020-02-06	qcom	Tamped down expectations for sales growth next quarter, saying the payoff from the introduction of smartphones capable of using new high-speed wireless networks will take longer than anticipated. The chipmaker gave a sales forecast for the second fiscal quarter that topped analysts’ estimates, but revenue will be little changed in the following three-month period ending in June, Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said. Analysts had predicted Qualcomm’s revenue would increase quarter over quarter through the year. “We expect the next inflection point with the launch of additional 5G flagship handsets to be in the fourth quarter and extend into fiscal 2021,” Palkhiwala said on the call. “We expect our third fiscal quarter performance to be in line with our second fiscal quarter.” Revenue will be $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ends in March, the San Diego-based company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $5.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Technology licensing revenue jumped 38% to $1.4 billion in the fiscal first quarter, but the company projected a decline to $1 billion to $1.2 billion in the current period. The chip division generated $3.6 billion, falling 3.2% from a year earlier. Qualcomm predicted sales will reach as much as $4.5 billion this quarter.

The planemaker identified the issue during flight testing and notified the Federal Aviation Administration last month, according to an email Thursday from Boeing. The problem was that an indicator light, designed to warn of a malfunction by a system that helps raise and lower the plane’s nose, was turning on when it wasn’t supposed to, the company said. “We are incorporating a change to the 737 Max software prior to the fleet returning to service to ensure that this indicator light only illuminates as intended,” the company said.

2020-02-07	mrk	The company’s plan to spin off its women’s health and biosimilar medicines units is sparking debate about its dependence on its top-selling drug among Wall Street analysts. The move to shed assets will further increase the drugmaker’s reliance on its blockbuster cancer medicine -- Keytruda -- and that’s not sitting well with some. That strategy may fuel a bulls vs bears controversy as Keytruda faces off against lower-priced competition in China and trial results may challenge the medicine’s supremacy in the U.S. A once “easy to own” story introduces a “valuation debate into a well-owned stock,” RBC analyst Randall Stanicky cautioned. “While perhaps unfair, we expect Keytruda concentration to become a bigger theme into competitor data that, while lower-risk, will add questions,” he wrote to clients in a note.
2020-02-07	uber	Said it will deliver a first-ever quarterly profit by the end of the year, signaling that cost-cutting measures are exceeding even the company’s own recent expectations. The company will become profitable, on an adjusted basis, by the fourth quarter of 2020, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive officer, said on a conference call to discuss financial results Thursday. A previous plan set this goal for 2021. For the fourth quarter, Uber edged out Wall Street’s expectations, with bookings up 28% and a loss that was narrower than analysts’ estimates. Gross bookings for the fourth quarter were $18.1 billion, showing demand for transportation and food delivery orders remains strong. The measure, which represents the total value of rides, food orders and other businesses, is closely watched by investors. Efforts to rein in spending are proving to be especially effective. The San Francisco-based company reported an adjusted loss of $615 million, compared with a $713 million average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The ride-hailing business was profitable on a standalone basis in the fourth quarter, Uber said. The company lost $130 million on its “other technology programs,” including the autonomous driving division, which is funded by Uber, SoftBank Group Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and others.

Alibaba said diluted non-GAAP earnings for the three months ending in December, the company's fiscal third quarter, were pegged at $2.61 per share, topping Wall Street's estimate of around $2.27 per share.

2020-02-12	ccl	Rising infection cases on board a quarantined cruise ship in Japan -- likely evidence passengers are spreading the virus to one another -- is raising concerns about their safety and sparking anger among the thousands still confined. There are now 174 infections aboard Carnival Corp.’s Diamond Princess, the largest infection cluster outside China. The surging numbers are fueling concerns that rather than keeping passengers safe, the quarantine is allowing the virus to spread through the ship. There were 39 new cases announced Wednesday, including 10 members of the crew. Separately, countries could continue to refuse to berth to a different ship, the Westerdam cruise ship carrying 2,257 people, citing unfounded fears of the deadly coronavirus, until conditions on the luxury liner become so dire that it invokes an emergency. The cruise ship operated by Carnival Corp.’s Holland America Line could be forced to wait until it’s in distress -- running out of water, food or fuel -- before international law-of-the-sea conventions kick in and legally obligate the closest country to admit the vessel or provide help, according to maritime experts.

The lack of an alert was cited as a factor in the crash by Indonesian investigators and Boeing’s failure to fix it drew stiff condemnation from lawmakers and families of the victims. Now the inoperable warning light is threatening to become a costly new headache for the planemaker: its absence on the jet violated U.S. Federal Aviation Administration regulations. The FAA is considering imposing civil penalties, according to documents and officials, which can amount to millions of dollars.

Now, a symbol of tech’s old guard is facing the stirrings of a worker uprising as well. People left their desks Thursday at Oracle offices around the world to protest Chairman Larry Ellison’s fundraiser a day earlier for President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. The protest, called No Ethics/No Work, involved about 300 employees walking out of their offices or stopping work at remote locations at noon local time and devoting the rest of the day to volunteering or civic engagement, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. Ellison drew employee ire that most didn’t know existed at Oracle. News of the fundraiser for Trump’s re-election campaign at Ellison’s home in Rancho Mirage, California, spurred a petition at Change.org from some of the company’s 136,000 employees. The workers argued the chairman’s public support for Trump violated Oracle’s diversity, inclusion and ethics policies, and harmed the image of the world’s second-largest software maker.

The conclusion they came to, though, was surprising: The problem wasn’t that there’d be too many mechanics idly milling around for months on end, but rather too few of them. So on Dec. 13, Boeing welcomed 115 new mechanics and assembly-line workers to its Pacific Northwest manufacturing hub.

2020-03-02	goog	Google Stadia isn't a game console, nor is it a game platform, really — it's a digital storefront run by Google where you can buy individual games. It's a hugely ambitious new platform, and it aimed to be the Netflix of gaming.  What makes Stadia so ambitious? Rather than downloading games or playing them off a Blu-ray disc, Stadia streams games to you wherever you are, like Netflix streams movies and TV shows. It's such a big deal, in fact, that Google CEO Sundar Pichai himself introduced Stadia back in March 2019 at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. However, four months after Stadia's launch, the service is still extremely light on games: Just 28 titles are available as of this week. Google says another 120 games are scheduled to hit Stadia this year, including some big upcoming blockbusters like "DOOM Eternal" and "Cyberpunk 2077."

Saudi Arabian state oil giant Aramco's move over the weekend to cut most of its official selling prices triggered the oil-price crash, with a barrel of Brent crude down 22% at $35.49 on Monday. Saudi officials said the kingdom also plans to boost crude output. An "oil price war unequivocally started this weekend" said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, noting the price cuts were Saudi Arabia's biggest according to some measures in at least 20 years.

2020-03-09	ba	U.S. regulators have told Boeing Co. that wiring on the 737 Max doesn’t meet legal standards because of the threat of a hazardous short-circuit, a decision that could require costly adjustments as the company attempts to get the grounded jet back in service. The plane could experience a rare but potentially dangerous failure if a handful of wires within bundles that snake through the fuselage come in contact with each other and short-circuit, the company discovered during an audit last year. Boeing had argued that the wiring had been installed nearly identically on the predecessor models of the 737, known as Next Generation, and had never experienced a dangerous issue. Even so, on Friday the Federal Aviation Administration notified the company that the Max’s wiring doesn’t meet federal rules and that Boeing will have to find a way to bring it into compliance, said a person familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named.

Shipments of Apple’s marquee device dropped to about 494,600 units from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on monthly data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think-tank. Overall mobile phone shipments, including Android devices, slid 56% to 6.4 million units, the academy said. Those year-earlier comparisons were skewed by the fact that the Lunar New Year holidays fell in February of 2019, versus January this year.

Icahn plans to run a proxy battle against Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub and the board later this year. The cut comes less than two weeks after Hollub said the payout was “one of the defining characteristics of our company” and vowed to protect it.

2020-03-12	ba	Shares fell in pre-market trading on Thursday, alongside airline stocks, as the growing coronavirus crisis prompted a restriction on travel from Europe to the U.S. The news comes after Boeing said Wednesday it was planning to draw down the full amount of a $13.8 billion loan, sparking investor concerns about liquidity. After falling 18% on Wednesday, Boeing’s stock took another 14% plunge in pre-market trading as JPMorgan downgraded shares, saying a dividend cut may be in the cards. Price targets were slashed across Wall Street. Despite that, some analysts said Wednesday’s slide was an overreaction, and the company was not in a liquidity crisis, even though pressures are rising. JPMorgan said, “Our desire to hang in with Boeing until the return of the 737 MAX has worked out poorly, both regarding the timeline for re-certification and now more importantly with the impact of Covid-19 on aircraft demand.” “With Boeing likely to burn over $5 billion of cash this year and a less certain path to recovery, given the damage that Covid-19 will do to operators, we think a dividend cut is on the table.” “The market may be pricing in an annual dividend cut to less than $5/share, which would free up about $2 billion of annual cash flow.”

Also, the relative quality of Citi’s credit card loans have improved materially over the last decade, the analyst said; lastly, while the company had its fair share of financial troubles during the great financial crisis, it is a different and much stronger bank today than it was back in 2007-2008, Harte added.

Over a third of the global fleet of 8,500 passenger planes have been parked, and scheduled flights this week will offer half as many total seats as in mid-January. When the coronavirus pandemic ends, many industry watchers now expect it will take years for airlines to return to their former size. That’s a bad scenario for airplane makers and their suppliers. Airlines will need 6,300 new aircraft over the next five years, estimates Robert Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, about 2,000 fewer than he’d forecast just a few months ago. That’s based on an estimate of a stomach-churning 40% reduction in airline passenger miles this year, roughly matching the industry group IATA’s forecast, and a slow recovery that only sees airline traffic return to 2018 levels in 2026.

The Federal Reserve remains reluctant to ease or lift its 2018 order capping the San Francisco-based lender’s assets because the company has yet to fully address concerns that prompted the unprecedented sanction, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The cap effectively prevents the bank from deploying a mountain of pent-up capital that could back a surge of lending.

Updates posted on clinicaltrials.gov show the two large trials have increased enrollment, revised primary and secondary endpoints and inclusion/exclusion criteria, and added patient groups, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note. These studies, which are expected to have results in May, are likely to be viewed by investors as more definitive than the first data on the drug coming out from China this month, Abrahams said. The changes should maximize chance of detecting a potential treatment effect, but they also imply that “the magnitude of benefit, if any, is likely to be modest,” Abrahams said.

2020-04-14	jpm	Said first-quarter profit tumbled 69% to the lowest in more than six years as credit costs surged, giving investors a first glimpse at the extent of the damage Covid-19 is wreaking on bank results. The company set aside $8.29 billion for bad loans, the biggest provision in at least a decade and more than double what some analysts expected, as it grappled with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. That prompted JPMorgan’s first drop in profit since the fourth quarter of 2017.  Revenue and profit fell in all but one of the bank’s four major business lines, driven by a 95% drop in net income in the massive consumer unit as the division set aside $5.77 billion of provisions for credit losses. The unit generated $191 million in profit. The corporate and investment bank, which houses the trading and banking businesses, was the most profitable unit, earning $1.99 billion, or 39% less than last year. The bank generated $7.23 billion from trading stocks and bonds, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Equities traders generated a record $2.24 billion in the quarter, 28% more than a year earlier, driven by derivatives. Bond-trading revenue rose 34% to $4.99 billion, the highest in nine years. The asset and wealth management unit was the only division to see revenue rise, up 3% from last year’s first quarter.  It total adjusted revenue decreased 2.6% y/y to  $29.07 billion, estimate $29.52 billion.  Overall the bank reported a profit of $2.87 billion, or 78 cents per share, down from a profit of $9.18 billion in the same period a year earlier. The results missed estimates, but analysts had struggled for weeks to figure out how to measure the coronavirus’s impact on companies like JPMorgan and the estimates varied wildly. The bank lowered its full-year outlook for net interest income  by $1.5 billion to $55.5 billion. The revenue source accounted for about half the company’s total last year, and in the past has helped counter more volatile results in the trading and investment-banking divisions. The crisis is still relatively new, and net charge-offs actually fell from the fourth quarter. But the bank increased its loan-loss reserve by more than $11 billion as it braced for higher credit-card defaults and saw corporate borrowers tap $50 billion worth of existing credit lines. The total allowance for possible loan losses rose to $25.4 billion, the highest since 2012, boosted by a $4.3 billion increase from new rules the bank had previously announced and a $6.8 billion reserve build. JPMorgan and other banks adopted a new accounting standard this year known as CECL, which aims to push banks to set aside provisions earlier in a cycle.
2020-04-14	jnj	First-quarter sales and earnings rose year-over-year and that it was lowering its guidance for 2020 as the company pushed forward with plans for a vaccine against the COVID-19 respiratory disease. Sales rose to $20.7 billion from $20 billion a year earlier. Earnings on an adjusted basis increased to $2.30 a share from $2.10 a share previously. The consensus on Capital IQ was for sales of $19.5 billion and normalized earnings of $2 a share. In the pharmaceutical segment, sales rose 10% to $11.13 billion, with gains for products like Stelara for inflammatory diseases and Darzalex for multiple myeloma. Consumer health sales were up 11% to $3.63 billion as over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol and Motrin drove the advance. But medical devices sales slowed 4.8% to $5.93 billion, as Johnson & Johnson said the COVID-19 pandemic led to deferrals of medical procedures. Projections for the year were lowered to a range of $77.5 billion to $80.5 billion from a previous outlook of $85.4 billion to $86.2 billion. The Capital IQ consensus is for $79.54 billion. Johnson & Johnson also said it sees adjusted earnings of $7.50 to $7.90 a share, down from the earlier range of $8.95 to $9.10 a share. The Street was looking for $8.08 a share. The updated guidance includes the investments that Johnson & Johnson is making to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said. Still, it plans to lift its quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $1.01 a share, payable on June 9 to investors on record by the close on May 26.

That contributed to a 89% drop in net income. The San Francisco-based bank made $653 million in profit compared with $5.86 billion in the year-earlier period. Earnings per share were 1 cent. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast 38 cents. Revenue of $17.72 billion was down 18% from $21.61 billion a year ago. That missed analyst expectations of $19.4 billion. Net interest margin widened to 2.58% from 2.53% in the last three months of 2019. The bank’s efficiency ratio, a measure of profitability, improved to 73.6% from 78.6% in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo has been beset by heightened costs stemming from its scandals. It had been targeting 55% to 59% in the long term, excluding litigation costs, though Scharf may set a different goal.

The company faces fines of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for each day’s delay. Amazon said it was considering lodging an appeal but such a move wouldn’t suspend the order that will be enforced on Wednesday early afternoon. Amazon said the court’s ruling “leaves us perplexed” since it said it has provided employees with security measures.

2020-04-15	bac	Reported Wednesday that its quarterly profits dropped by 45% from a year ago, the latest major bank to say it took a hard hit from the coronavirus pandemic. The amount of money BofA set aside for loan losses nearly quintupled from a year ago, from $1.01 billion to $4.76 billion. The losses came from the bank’s consumer lending division — BofA is a large credit card issuer and has a massive consumer banking business. The bank also reserved for bad loans in its lending division to businesses. Despite the hit, BofA’s results were notably stronger than rivals JPMorgan and Wells, who both saw steeper profit declines and proportionately set aside more money to cover loan losses. The Charlotte, N.C. based bank said it earned a profit of $4.01 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $7.31 billion or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. The results missed analysts’ expectations, however forecasts for the banks varied widely due to the fact the pandemic happened suddenly. The bank’s Wall Street division beat expectations. Equities trading was a standout, as revenue surged 39% to $1.67 billion on rising client activity and volatile financial markets. Fixed-income trading revenue jumped 13% to $2.67 billion on better market-making conditions, particularly in rates markets. Investment banking fees rose 9.8% to $1.39 billion, lifted by higher debt and equity underwriting. Net interest income -- revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the company pays depositors -- fell 2% to $12.1 billion in the first quarter. On a fully taxable-equivalent basis, the figure was $12.3 billion, exceeding the $11.7 billion average estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
2020-04-15	c	First-quarter profit plunged 46%, after the bank set aside nearly $5 billion to prepare for a wave of loan defaults as the coronavirus pandemic pummels the global economy. Citigroup's profit for the first three months of the year fell to $2.52 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $4.71 billion, or $1.87 a share. Analysts had expected $1.07 a share, according to FactSet, a forecast that has been cut in half since late February. Revenue rose 12% to $20.73 billion, compared with $18.58 billion a year earlier and the $19.03 billion analysts expected. Citigroup increased its loan loss provision, money for loans it now thinks can go bad, by $4.92 billion, from just $278 million in the prior quarter. Of that, $2.85 billion came in the consumer bank and another $1.88 billion in the corporate bank. Its total provision in the quarter was $7 billion.

The technology giant’s new iPhone costs $399, several hundred dollars cheaper than the flagship iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro lines. To get to the lower cost, Apple is using an iPhone 8 design that debuted in 2017 along with a less advanced camera system, a smaller and older display and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner instead of 3-D facial recognition. While many of the device’s specifications have been surpassed by newer technology at this point, the iPhone SE does use the same A13 processor as the latest flagship iPhone. This also gives Apple a more competitive model in countries such as India that are flooded with cheaper Android phones.

2020-04-17	uber	Withdrew its financial guidance for 2020 and said it will write down about $2 billion in investments after the coronavirus pandemic upended the ride-hailing business. The San Francisco-based company said the writedown of its minority investments will range from $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion.

A financial assistance program created by the company for drivers and delivery people coping with the effects of the virus will have a marginal impact on revenue. The result will be a $17 million to $22 million reduction in that quarter and $60 million to $80 million in the second quarter, Uber said.

2020-04-24	gild	Shares were whipsawed for the second time in a week after a summary of a Chinese trial of its Covid-19 drug appeared to show that it was a failure. The World Health Organization, which has been helping coordinate the global response to the virus, said it accidentally posted the results on a website that helps track therapies for the disease. The summary was quickly removed, but details of the post were reported by the Financial Times and posted by the publication Stat. They showed that the drug wasn’t associated with patients getting better more quickly; and 13.9% of patients getting the drug died, versus 12.8% getting standard care. The drug company and a scientist involved in the trial disputed the characterizations of the result as an outright failure, however. “That is not correct,” said Frederick Hayden, an infectious disease expert at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, when asked whether the results showed remdesivir had flopped. Hayden helped the Chinese doctors conduct the study. “My interpretation of them is not consistent with that headline.” Gilead, in a statement, said that the summary mischaracterizes the results of the study, which was stopped early after not enough patients could be found. A study with low enrollment can lead to results that are less conclusive. Hayden said there was a mistake in the original manuscript and that it had since been revised. Gilead, in its statement, said that “trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early.” The company said that the full data are being submitted for review and publication. In a follow-up statement, the company said the data “add to a growing but still inconclusive body of evidence for remdesivir.” It expects full results from two other, larger studies at the end of May.

Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, widened to 60.6% in the quarter.  The company benefitted from the work-at-home trends from the pandemic.  Those trends fueled a 14% increase in PC-related chip sales in the first quarter, and a 43% gain in the company’s data-center division. The company gave an optimistic second-quarter sales target, but Intel’s profit outlook fell short of estimates, sparking concerns that a spending slowdown will drag on business for the rest of 2020.

Total revenue fell 8% to $12.03 billion, although that was ahead of the consensus on Capital IQ, which was for $11.38 billion. Revenue in the biopharma business was up 11% to $10.01 billion. Upjohn, the company's division that includes drugs like Lipitor for cholesterol and Lyrica for pain treatment, saw revenue drop 37% to $2.02 billion mainly from the loss of US exclusivity for Lyrica and declines in China. For 2020, it affirmed guidance in a range of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion, while adjusted earnings were held at $2.82 to $2.92 a share. The Street is expecting $2.70 in earnings and $47.01 billion in revenue.

2020-04-29	ba	Posted a wider-than-expected first quarter loss Wednesday, but insisted it could raise cash from financial markets and potentially avoid tapping government funds, and ceding equity, to steady the business. Boeing said core non-GAAP earnings for the three months ending in March was pegged at a loss of $1.70 per share, compared to a $3.16 profit over the same period last year and a Street consensus forecast of $1.60 per share. Group revenues, Boeing said, plunged 26.25% to $16.9 billion, well shy of analysts' estimates of $17.306 billion. Free cash flow swung to a negative $4.73 billion from positive $2.29 billion, but that beat the FactSet consensus of negative $5.79 billion. Commercial airplane revenue fell 48% to $6.21 billion, but was above expectations of $5.94 billion, while defense, space and security revenue declined 8% to $6.04 billion versus expectations of a rise to $6.76 billion. Boeing said access to additional liquidity will be "critical" for the company, after its cash burn rate hit -$4.73 billion over the first quarter,  and said it was "actively exploring all of the available options" and believes it "will be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to fund its operations."   The company also announced that it is planning to cut 10% of its workforce and to slow production.

Analysts predicted 7 cents in per share earnings. GE says the pandemic cost the company $1 billion in first- quarter cash flow and $800 million in industrial operating profit. Excluding that impact, industrial profit margins were a little higher year over year. Regarding the balance sheet, GE recently refinanced billions in debt, signed new credit facilities and closed on the $20 billion deal to sell its biopharma unit to Danaher (DHR). Debt at GE and GE Capital fell $7 billion and $4 billion, respectively.

Testing of the medication has begun in Germany and could start in the U.S. next week if health regulators agree to that, Bourla told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. Results from the study may emerge as soon as May, he said. But Pfizer would still need to complete additional safety testing. If the vaccine passes through all the testing levels, Pfizer could start distributing it on an emergency basis in the fall and perhaps gain regulators' clearance for widespread distribution this year, Bourla said.
2020-04-29	sbux	Said global same-store sales dropped 10% in its second quarter as a result of the coronavirus crisis, the first downturn by that measure in nearly 11 years. The coffee giant said Tuesday that it expects the impact of the pandemic to be even larger in its current quarter, and to continue to depress its business to a lesser extent later in the year. Starbucks said the pandemic cut its profit in the Americas by $450 million as it lost sales, spent on safety supplies and boosted wages for workers. Earnings per share adjusted for unforeseen expenses, including the added worker pay, came to 32 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 34 cents a share.

2020-04-30	amzn	The U.S. identified five of Amazon.com Inc.’s foreign domains as notorious markets and will seek more information on them. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative listed Amazon’s platforms in Canada, Germany, France, India and the U.K., it said in an annual report to Congress Wednesday. This year’s report focuses on the nexus between online piracy and malware and for the first time lists a U.S.-headquartered company’s foreign domains. Amazon responded in a statement Wednesday, saying it disagrees with its inclusion on the list and called the action politically motivated. The Seattle-based company said it “strictly prohibits counterfeit products” and that 99% of pages viewed worldwide by customers on Amazon have never had a report of counterfeit.

The company had been in constant communication with regulators at the Food and Drug Administration, and these communications have picked up in intensity in the last few days as the results of big trials have started to roll in. While a formal approval would likely take months and require far more robust results than what the company has revealed so far, during the outbreak the FDA has shown a willingness to clear medical products for emergency use with far less data than usual.
2020-04-30	msft	In the quarter that ended March 31, Microsoft earned $10.8 billion, or $1.40 per share, on $35 billion in sales. Earnings jumped 22 percent from the year-ago quarter, while sales grew 15 percent. Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report per-share earnings of $1.27 on revenue of $33.7 billion.

That’s above the $10.6 billion estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg.  For the unit that includes Office software -- both cloud and traditional sales -- revenue climbed to $11.7 billion. That compares with the $11.5 billion average Wall Street prediction. Microsoft noted a few financial setbacks from the pandemic. Supply chain constraints in China held back its Windows and Surface business toward the end of the quarter. And cuts in advertising spending hurt revenue from its LinkedIn professional-networking service and its Web search business. LinkedIn's sales growth, which was 21 percent in the quarter, will face "a significant slowdown" to mid-single-digit growth as the job market tightens, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said during the analyst call. For the quarter ending in June, Microsoft said sales in the More Personal Computing unit will be $11.3 billion to $11.7 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $11.14 billion. Productivity division revenue will be $11.65 billion to $11.95 billion. Analysts predicted $12.1 billion. Intelligent Cloud division revenue will be $12.9 billion to $13.15 billion.

The San Diego-based company shipped 129 million chips in the quarter, a roughly 17% decline from the previous quarter but within its guidance of 125 million to 145 million.  Qualcomm said the coronavirus pandemic led to a roughly 21% decline in handset demand compared with its projections and cut its guidance for the current quarter by about 30%, projecting 125 million to 145 million in chip shipments.

Meanwhile, revenue rose to $5.22 billion from $4.98 billion a year earlier. The results beat Wall Street expectations for adjusted profit and revenue, according to FactSet. This quarter, Qualcomm expects 29 cents to 49 cents a share in profit, or 60 cents to 80 cents a share on an adjusted basis, and $4.4 billion to $5.2 billion in revenue. Analysts expect 57 cents a share, or 78 cents a share as adjusted, on $4.89 billion in revenue.

Sales in Amazon’s physical stores category, which is almost entirely Whole Food Market stores, rose 8% to $4.6 billion in the quarter, the largest increase since Amazon bought the organic grocer in 2017.  Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit that in recent years has accounted for most of the company’s operating income, posted sales of $10.2 billion, up 33%, and just below analysts’ estimates. The company forecast that 2Q operating income could range from $1.5 billion to a loss of $1.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, as spending on Covid related expenses hurt profits.
2020-05-01	cvx	Posted stronger-than-expected first quarter revenues Friday, and pledged to protect its dividend, amid the biggest three-month decline in history for global crude prices. Chevron said diluted earnings for the three months ending in March came in at $1.93 per share, a 38.8% increase from the same period last year that included some one-time items that pushed it well ahead of the Street consensus forecast of 68 per share.

Chevron also said it would make a further $2 billion in cuts to its capital spending plans, while reducing operating costs by another $1 billion, as it attempts to protect the group's dividend and maintain a strong balance sheet.

Group revenues, Exxon said, fell 11.7% to $56.16 billion but topped analysts' estimates of $51.85 billion. Oil and natural gas output rose 2% during the period.  The company said it would slash its 2020 capital spending plans by around 30%, to $23 billion, as it moves to protect both its dividend and the strength of its balance sheet.

Gilead Sciences Inc. said it has moved to expand manufacturing of remdesivir, a drug meant to treat patients with serious cases of Covid-19. The company said on Thursday it expects more than 140,000 treatment courses of the drug to be made by the end of May. Gilead spent about $50 million on research and development related to the drug in the first quarter, or about 4.5% of its total R&D spend. The company said it expects "more than one million treatment courses will be manufactured by December 2020, with plans to be able to produce several million treatment courses in 2021." Gilead will donate the more than 140,000 treatment courses it expects to manufacture by the end of May, but has indicated that it will charge money for the drug after that time. Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said again on Thursday that the company will be thoughtful about creating a sustainable business model for the drug going forward that makes it affordable and accessible to patients globally.  However, analysts appear concerned with the company’s plan and it received several downgrades over the lack of a clear path to profit from remdesivir.

2020-05-01	v	Warned the firm will be challenged “for a number of quarters” even as declines in spending on its network began to moderate in April. As the U.S. government began sending out stimulus payments to millions of consumers this month, Visa saw an increase in spending on home improvement, automotive and some areas of health care. Still, spending on the firm’s cards in the U.S. has dropped 19% in April compared with the same period a year earlier. To offset the slowdown in spending on its cards, Visa said expenses in the second half of the year would be flat compared with the same period a year ago. The company, which has vowed it won’t make any virus-related layoffs this year, said costs rose 4% to $1.93 billion in the first three months of the year, below the $2.02 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  More than one-fifth of the U.S. spending on Visa’s network comes from food and drug stores, Walmart Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Target Corp. -- and that’s the only category to post an increase in April, climbing 20%. Spending on items like telecommunications, utilities, insurance and business supplies and equipment has been flat in April. Cross-border spending -- among the most lucrative transactions for Visa and its rival Mastercard Inc. -- fell 2% in the quarter ended March 31 as global travel ground to a halt. Still, declines in such spending moderated later, Visa said in a presentation on its website. Visa said net revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $5.85 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Profit climbed 4% to $3.08 billion, or $1.38 a share, topping the $1.34 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

However, gains in the insurance unit’s investing portfolio helped push operating earnings up almost 6% to $5.87 billion. BNSF reported a 5.2% decrease in volume in the first quarter and Precision Castparts reported lower sales across all of its major markets, partially because of the pandemic and Boeing Co.’s 737 Max issues. The company’s footwear and apparel businesses were also hit, reporting a 34% decline in earnings.  The company’s cash stockpile swelled to $137 billion.  Berkshire bought back $1.7 billion of its shares in the first quarter and was a net seller of stocks through April as it shed stakes in four major U.S. airlines.  When asked at his annual shareholder meeting why the company was not actively buying during the downturn, Mr. Buffett said “We have not done anything because we don’t see anything that attractive to do.” The deals in 2008 and 2009 weren’t done to make “a statement to the world,” he said. “They seemed intelligent things to do and markets were such that we didn’t really have much competition.” The approach seems to put him in the camp of other notable investors who think markets may not have seen the worst of the impact from the pandemic.

2020-05-06	all	Profit fell in the first quarter as revenue declined, and the insurer also logged $210 million in costs for its Shelter-in-Place Payback program that it adopted because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Allstate's profit was $549 million, or $1.59 a share, down from $1.29 billion, or $3.74 a share, a year ago. First-quarter adjusted earnings were $3.54 a share, Allstate said. According to FactSet, the consensus from analysts was for $3.36 a share. Revenue fell 8.3% to $10.08 billion. The company reported realized capital losses of $462 million compared with realized capital gains of $662 million a year ago. Total expenses at Allstate rose just half a percent from a year ago. Allstate Corp. sold about $4 billion of equities in February, softening the blow slightly from the first quarter’s market turmoil. The insurer’s sale of two-thirds of its public equity holdings came ahead of the nearly 13% slump in the S&P 500 Index in March and helped ease a volatile period in which the company’s net investment income fell 35%. Allstate invested proceeds from the stock sale in investment-grade fixed-income securities.

2020-05-06	dis	Shares fell in pre-market trading after the company’s second-quarter results underlined the broad-based hit the media company is taking from the pandemic. Adjusted earnings were more than 30% below expectations, the biggest miss in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Despite the weakness, analysts continue to be positive on the company’s Disney+ streaming-video service. Earnings plunged by more than half to 60 cents a share in Disney’s second quarter, excluding some items. That trailed the 86-cent average of analysts’ estimates. Revenue rose 21% to $18 billion, but that was driven by the acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets last year. The worst performance in Disney’s latest quarter came from the theme-park division, where operating income tumbled to $639 million from $1.51 billion a year earlier.  Profits at the film studio, which has been unable to show movies in theaters since mid-March, dropped 8%.  In the company’s TV business, operating income rose 7% as increased sales of TV shows and the Fox merger boosted results.  Disney’s direct-to-consumer division performed better than expected. Losses at the division, which includes Disney+, came in at $812 million -- less than the $900 million analysts were projecting. The company said it will forgo its July dividend payment, saving about $1.6 billion, and cut capital spending by $900 million. Losses in the quarter were mitigated somewhat by a $150 million employee tax credit that was part of the federal coronavirus relief legislation. Disney also offered some near-term hope for the theme-park business, saying its resort in Shanghai will reopen on May 11.

2020-05-07	bmy	Reported higher first-quarter revenue, helped in part by higher demand for some products tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. "The quarter benefited by approximately $500 million due to Covid-19 related buying patterns," the company said on Thursday. Bristol-Myers said it generated $10.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 82% year-over-year, an increase explained by its acquisition of Celgene in November, which affects comparability. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $10.03 billion in revenue. Assuming the company had owned Celgene and divested from one other drug as of Jan. 2019, revenue was up 13% year-over-year, or 8% excluding the impact of the pandemic. The company's adjusted profit of $1.72 a share was higher than the consensus estimate of $1.49 a share for that metric. The company still sees FY adjusted EPS $6.00 to $6.20, estimate $6.08, and FY revenue $40 billion to $42 billion, saw $40.5 billion to $42.5 billion, estimate $41.62 billion.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected a $1.38 billion net loss on sales of $3.53 billion for the quarter just ended. Uber posted a $612 million first-quarter loss on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which excludes costs linked to its Covid-19 response.

The EU will review whether Apple’s app store violates competition law by requiring developers to accept a 30% commission for every sale on Apple’s platform. Watchdogs will also examine how Apple limits “tap-and-go” functionality to its own Apple Pay product. “It appears that Apple obtained a ‘gatekeeper’ role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple’s popular devices,” Vestager said in a statement on Tuesday. “We need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers, for example with its music streaming service Apple Music or with Apple Books.” The investigation is the latest in a growing list of EU probes into Silicon Valley, which have led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. The EU last year wrapped up nearly a decade of probes into Google that racked up some $9 billion in fines. An investigation into Amazon.com is set to escalate in the coming weeks.

2020-06-18	ba	A Senate committee chairman sharply criticized the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday for what he alleged were repeated failures to respond to a committee’s investigations, including into two crashes of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican head of the Senate Commerce Committee, accused the FAA of delaying interviews with its employees and failing to turn over documents as he opened a hearing at which the agency’s chief, Steve Dickson, was called to testify. After more than a year of what he said was a failure to respond to the committee’s investigation into whistle-blower complaints, Wicker said the agency had “deliberately attempted to keep us in the dark.” “It is hard not to characterize a relationship during this entire process as being adversarial on the part of the FAA,” the Mississippi lawmaker said. “Mr. Dickson, I hold you responsible for this.”
2020-06-18	baba	JD and larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. this month put Chinese consumption to its first major test since Beijing locked down the country in February. China’s largest retailers are hoping the “6.18” summer extravaganza that wraps up Thursday has unleashed pent-up demand, making up for lost sales during a coronavirus-stricken March quarter. JD said it had racked up 239.2 billion yuan ($34 billion) of transactions as of mid-afternoon, up 33% from the same time a year earlier and already surpassing 2019’s total. The retailer’s shares rose 3.5% on their Hong Kong debut, after raising $3.9 billion in a stock sale designed to appeal to Asian investors.

2020-06-18	ccl	Cruise titan Carnival Corp. reported a second-quarter loss of $4.4 billion, including $2 billion in impairment charges, and warned that it can’t predict when it will be able to resume operations given the lingering coronavirus shutdown. The world’s largest cruise company said its adjusted net loss for the period ended May 31, excluding the charges, was $3.30 a share. That is far deeper than analysts’ expectation of a $1.95 loss. Revenue was just $700 million, a plunge from the year-earlier $4.8 billion. Carnival’s shares skidded in early trading. While rival Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. this week extended its cruising suspension through the end of September, Carnival said it couldn’t provide a resumption target at all. Norwegian’s announcement slammed the brakes on what had been a remarkable recovery for cruise stocks, and Carnival’s further downbeat news is likely to extend the losses.
2020-06-18	cvx	Will start a sales process for its interest in the North West Shelf project in Australia, one of the nation’s first liquefied natural gas export ventures, after receiving a number of approaches from potential buyers. The U.S. energy major has been looking to make cutbacks as the industry grapples with a once-in-a-generation collapse in demand because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company made the decision to start a formal marketing process for its 16.67% stake after receiving unsolicited approaches “from a range of credible buyers,” it said in an emailed statement Thursday. Analysts estimate that the stake could be worth $3 billion to $4 billion, with the value seen reduced following a sharp drop in LNG prices this year. Prior to the pandemic, valuations had ranged as high as $6 billion.
2020-06-18	dis	Hong Kong Disneyland reopened Thursday under health restrictions to check the spread of infections in a pandemic that’s seeing a second wave of outbreaks, including a flare up this week in Beijing. About 100 visitors were lined up Thursday morning to enter the park, which had been closed since late January. The scene was more subdued than the mid-May restart of operations at Shanghai Disneyland, which drew long lines including fans dressed head-to-toe in Disney character costumes. Walt Disney Co., which counted on theme parks for about 46% of operating income in the year ended September, has said it will limit capacity at reopened parks to help keep visitors safe amid the pandemic. The entertainment giant did not say what the attendance limit would be for Hong Kong Disneyland, while the company had previously said it would initially sell tickets at less than one-third of full capacity at Shanghai Disneyland.
2020-06-18	goog	The Justice Department on Wednesday outlined a broad overhaul of legal protections for online platforms such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. if they deliberately promote illegal speech on their websites. The proposals, which could upend the companies’ business models, would also have the effect of limiting their discretion over removing political posts and take away liability protection for encrypted platforms such as FaceBook’s WhatsApp. The recommendations for legislation follow a feud between President Donald Trump and Twitter Inc., which last month slapped fact-checks on some of his tweets, prompting him to issue an executive order aimed at narrowing the liability shield enjoyed by social-media companies. Trump and his supporters contend they’re treated unfairly when their assertions are challenged or blocked by the internet platforms. The companies enjoy immunity from lawsuits over the content that their users post under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, a key measure that allowed online companies to flourish in the early days of the internet. Now the provision has become a target of lawmakers from both parties who object to its breadth and describe it as a giveaway to technology companies.

The San Diego-based company said its 5G-capable Snapdragon 690 chips will be in some devices from companies including LG Electronics Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd.’s Motorola by the second half of this year. The mobile industry is rushing to bring fifth-generation services and devices to market in an attempt to fire up consumer interest in smartphones again sales collapsed during the Covid-19 lockdown. 5G networks, which were switched on in the middle of last year, promise faster data speed, quicker response times and the ability to connect a range of previously unconnected electronics. While the first year of 4G networks saw just a handful of expensive phones offered and a limited number of networks switched on, Qualcomm said there are currently more than 375 5G-capable devices that have been announced and over 60 wireless operators have begun 5G service.
2020-06-18	uber	Is getting into software. The company is making the technology that powers its ride-hailing business available to others, starting with public transit agencies. California’s Marin County transportation providers are the first customers to buy access to Uber’s software in a deal the company announced Wednesday. The tie-up represents a potential new revenue stream for Uber at a time when the company could use it. “This is not a one-off. This is a new product and a new business,” said David Reich, head of Uber Transit, adding that the company intends to partner with other transit agencies in the future. “Together we want to make car ownership a thing of the past.” But the effort is starting small. The program, called Marin Connect, will power logistics for just four wheelchair-accessible vans when it begins on July 1. Teaming up with Marin Transit and the Transportation Authority of Marin, it will also make public transit schedules and discounts available within the Uber app in the county, and will offer vouchers for riders traveling the last mile to their destinations from transit stops.

Woodside Petroleum Ltd. on Tuesday reiterated that it would consider buying Chevron Corp.’s stake in North West Shelf and indicated that other joint venture partners could be looking to exit. That may mark the end of a delicate balance at Australia’s biggest LNG project, where six international partners have equal stakes, as the plant needs to find new gas supplies to keep on humming. As operator Woodside is viewed by many in the industry as the logical buyer for Chevron’s stake. The U.S. oil major announced last week it would start a formal marketing process after receiving unsolicited approaches from potential buyers, though the other five stakeholders have pre-emptive rights.

2020-06-29	hrtx	Received a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its New Drug Application for HTX-011 for the management of postoperative pain. CRL stated that the FDA is unable to approve the NDA in its present form based on the need for additional non-clinical information. FDA did not identify any clinical safety or efficacy issues or CMC issues. Four non-clinical issues in the CRL, none of which relate to any observed toxicity. Company does not believe any of the issues are significant barriers to ultimate approval. Company will request a Type A meeting to obtain agreement with the agency, resubmit the application as quickly as possible. We just got off the Heron Conference call regarding the CLR for HTX-011.  While this was unexpected and disappointing, the issues raised in the CLR appear to be trivia and many analysts questioned why the FDA did not just call the company to get this matter resolved.  Analysts and the company speculated that the agency is likely just stalling because it is overstretched due to COVID-19. There were four issues that the FDA asked that company to address: three of which dealt excipient (or inactive ingredient) studies regarding reproductive toxicology.  The company noted that all three excipients are currently being used in approved products, some of which had been in use for over 30 years.  The company said they had previously provided data on these same excipients to the FDA as part of the prior CLR and it appears that this is follow-up data the FDA would like to have.  Given there have been prior studies on reproductive toxicology, the company did not think any new trials would be needed; however, they did note that if a trail was required, they should be able to complete it within six months. The other issue dealt with the acceptable level of impurities allowed in the drug.  Heron said that this was just a paperwork issues, as their drug already achieves the level requested by the FDA.  Therefore no reformulation or changes to manufacturing will be needed – only a change in paperwork will be required to set the new acceptable level for impurities for product quality testing going forward. Heron is requesting a Type A meeting with the FDA to respond to the issues raised by the CRL. The FDA must schedule this meeting within 30 days.

The bank posted a profit of $1.32 billion, down from $4.8 billion a year earlier. At 50 cents per share, the results exceeded the average analyst estimate of 35 cents a share, according to FactSet. Per-share earnings were $1.95 a year ago. Revenue rose 5% to $19.77 billion. Citigroup's loan-loss provision included $2.21 billion in net charge-offs and $5.7 billion it added to its reserves for loans that might default in the future. Analysts had expected the total would be $7.36 billion. Citigroup had already put aside $7.03 billion in the first quarter for potentially souring loans and now has a total $28.28 billion allowance for loan losses as of the end of June.

2020-07-14	jpm	The biggest U.S. bank said second-quarter profit fell 51% to $4.69 billion, a smaller drop than forecast, as record trading revenue helped counter the biggest loan-loss provision in the firm’s history. The firm’s fixed-income trading revenue doubled from a year earlier and the equity-markets unit surged more than 30% as trading desks benefited from a roller-coaster year. The bank generated $9.72 billion from trading stocks and bonds, 79% more than a year earlier and a bigger jump than analysts were expecting. That and a 91% gain in investment-banking fees helped the company easily remain profitable even as it set aside $10.5 billion to cover future bad loans, a record that was also higher than estimates. Net charge-offs, overdue loans the bank no longer expects to recover, rose 6% from the first three months of the year to $1.56 billion in the second quarter. But that was far less than the $2.78 billion predicted by analysts. Revenue rose across all of the bank’s business lines except the consumer unit, where it fell 9% from a year earlier to $12.2 billion. Net interest income slipped 4% to $13.9 billion in the second quarter as the impact of lower interest rates offset a 2% increase in the bank’s total loan book compared with last year.  Overall, second-quarter net income fell to $4.69 billion, or $1.38 a share, from $9.65 billion, or $2.82, a year earlier. That beat the $1.01 per-share average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted revenue totaled $33.82 billion, +14% y/y, estimate $30.57 billion.

Non-interest expenses rose to $14.6 billion from $13.4 billion a year ago. Costs in the second quarter were boosted by $1.2 billion that the firm attributed primarily to customer remediation tied to scandals in recent years.  Nonperforming assets jumped 22% from the first quarter, largely driven by soured loans to the oil and gas and commercial real estate industries. .  Net interest income fell by $2.2 billion from a year earlier to $9.9 billion. Overall, revenue fell to $17.8 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $18.5 billion and the company reported a loss per share 66c vs. EPS $1.30 y/y, estimate loss/share 13c.

Group revenues, AT&T said, fell 8.9% from last year to $41.billion, just shy of analysts' estimates of $41.1 billion. AT&T said it had around 36 million customers logged for its newly-launched HBO Max service (including legacy HBO subscribers) after adding around 3 million over the second quarter. Postpaid mobile phone subscribers, however, fell by 151,000 against market forecasts of additions totaling around 7,000. The postpaid figure t included 338,000 still-active lines that the carrier took off its rolls but avoided disconnecting under the federal government's Keep Americans Connected pledge. That voluntary forbearance program ended in July after several telecom companies balked at footing the bill for more nonpaying accounts past the summer. At the same time, the company posted a net gain of 135,000 prepaid phone customers, a sign of how many Americans' economic distress is changing how they shop for wireless plans. AT&T's shrinking traditional-TV business showed why the company needs its new online service to succeed.

2020-07-24	intc	Shares slumped after warning about another production delay, sparking concern the world’s largest chipmaker will fall further behind rivals in a crucial area it once dominated. Intel’s first 7-nanometer chips will go on sale at the end of 2022 or early 2023, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on a conference call. That’s a year behind schedule. AMD is already selling 7-nanometer-based processors. Mr. Swan spent almost an hour on Thursday discussing an idea that would once have been unthinkable for the world’s largest semiconductor company: Not manufacturing its own chips. Outsourcing is the norm in the $400 billion industry nowadays, but for 50 years Intel has combined chip design with in-house production.  For now, the production woes have damaged Intel’s reputation rather than its finances. Second-quarter revenue jumped 20% to $19.7 billion from a year earlier. Net income was $1.19 a share. Both topped analysts’ estimates.

2020-08-04	ba	The FAA has proposed a long list of fixes to Boeing Co.’s grounded 737 Max in one of the most extensive set of requirements the agency has issued following an accident. The FAA on Monday asked for public comment on the changes it expects to require to the plane linked to two fatal crashes.

The release of the FAA proposal shows that, after 16 months of the plane’s grounding and a series of investigative reports and congressional hearings, aviation regulators are satisfied that the fixes will allow the plane to safely resume service.

2020-08-04	bp	Revenue plunged to $31.19 billion during the three months that ended June 30 from $73.75 billion a year ago, the London-based company said in its earnings statement on Tuesday. Underlying replacement cost loss -- BP's preferred measure of profitability -- dropped to $6.7 billion from a profit of $2.8 billion a year earlier, in line with estimates.  The group said the loss was mainly due to upstream exploration write-offs of $6.5 billion after tax.  Excluding the impairment charges, the sharp drop in revenue from BP’s oil and gas production and the worst refining profit margins in 15 years were offset by an “exceptionally strong contribution” by trading operations. BP cut its quarterly dividend 50% to 5.25 cents per share and intends it to remain fixed at that level as part of its new distribution policy. Going forward, the group plans to return at least 60% of surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks after deleveraging its balance sheet and subject to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating.

Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi on Thursday said business in Asia was bouncing back, with ride bookings in Hong Kong and New Zealand, where the pandemic has eased, "at times exceeding pre-Covid highs."

But when virus-spooked Americans began avoiding stores earlier this year and shifting spending online, far more Walmart customers went to Amazon.com Inc. than Walmart.com.

In the first week of August, that gap narrowed to 55 cents to Walmart and 45 cents to Amazon. Walmart, through a spokesman, declined to comment.

The move would have been unthinkable a few years ago. But Chapek -- less than six months after succeeding longtime CEO Bob Iger -- is using the Covid-19 crisis to transform Disney much faster than expected, all with an eye toward making the company an online juggernaut that reaches far more people worldwide. Besides scrapping the networks, he shut down a musical version of the animated film “Frozen” that opened with much fanfare on Broadway two years ago, closed a chain of English-language schools in China, and scaled back a $1 billion resort-technology project that has largely been replaced by a simple mobile-phone app.

2020-08-12	qcom	The chipmaker won a major victory Tuesday in a federal appeals court, which unanimous  ruled that a judge was wrong to side with the Federal Trade Commission in 2019 in finding that Qualcomm had violated antitrust law. The appeals court also vacated an order that the company redo licensing accords with smartphone makers like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Such licenses generated $4.6 billion in revenue for Qualcomm last year. The case won’t return to the trial judge, but the FTC can ask that it be reconsidered by the full appeals court. If Tuesday’s ruling stands, it’ll represent the end of years of legal and regulatory entanglements for the company. On this ruling, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore raised the target on Qualcomm Inc. to $127 from $115. Maintains buy rating.
2020-08-11	aapl	If President Trump's threat to ban WeChat were enacted, Apple could lose a major chunk of its iPhone sales according to one analyst.

That estimate reflects WeChat's status as an essential "super-app" for its heavy users, most of whom are concentrated in China. In addition to messaging and calls, WeChat serves as a platform for everything from payments and ride hailing to productivity and ecommerce.

A judge’s ruling Monday won’t be the last word, as Uber and Lyft vowed to immediately appeal the preliminary injunction. If the companies are forced to reclassify their California drivers as employees, they would be on the hook for overtime, health care and other costly benefits. The case brought by California officials to enforce a state labor law that took effect this year is the most serious legal threat yet to the gig economy -- and comes at a particularly difficult time for the ride-hailing businesses.

The bundles, dubbed “Apple One” inside the Cupertino, California-based technology giant, are planned to launch as early as October alongside the next iPhone line, the people said.

Codenamed “Seymour,” the workout package would rival virtual classes offered by companies including Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc., according to the people. The new bundles will be geared toward families, meaning they will work with Apple’s Family Sharing system that provides access to as many as six people for each service. The offerings are designed to save consumers about $2 to upwards of $5 a month, depending on the package chosen.

2020-08-14	aapl	Yanked "Fortnite," one of the world's most popular videogames, from their app stores in an escalating battle over the fees they charge developers to distribute their software and process in-app purchases. The conflict reflects growing pushback against Apple's App Store and Alphabet Inc.'s Google Play store on how they operate. Other app makers, including Netflix Inc. and Spotify Technology SA, have also butted heads with Apple on developer fees. At stake is a global market for mobile apps that generates roughly $120 billion annually, according to App Annie Inc. The decisions from Apple and Google Thursday preventing people from downloading or updating the "Fortnite" app came after the game's creator, closely held Epic Games Inc., rolled out a new way of making in-game purchases that circumvents the 30% cut tech giants take from digital transactions within apps. The survival game is free to download but generates revenue through purchases of items such as digital costumes and dance moves for players' avatars. After "Fortnite" was booted from the App Store, Epic sued Apple in U.S. District Court in California on Thursday, accusing the company of monopolistic behavior in how it distributes apps to devices and processes payments for digital content. Epic said it isn't seeking monetary damages from Apple but asked the court to issue an injunction to end Apple's "unreasonable and unlawful practices," according to the complaint.

2020-08-18	c	The company’s accidental payment of about $900 million to Revlon Inc.’s lenders is facing scrutiny on two fronts -- in private talks with regulators and a public fight in court. Behind the scenes, the bank has begun briefing watchdogs including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve about how it mistakenly misdirected so much money, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential talks. On Monday, the bank sued Brigade Capital Management LP, seeking to recoup a share of the wayward funds. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, hasn’t offered a public explanation of how the “operational mistake,” as its lawsuit labeled it, occurred. While errors are inevitable in an industry that moves trillions of dollars daily, the massive over-payments have captivated Wall Street and raised questions about safeguards within the firm’s franchise tending to syndicated loans. Citigroup was preparing to resign as administrative agent for the Revlon loan when it accidentally wired roughly $900 million to the lenders’ accounts last week amid a bitter fight between the cosmetics company and creditors. While some opted to return the funds to Citigroup, others including Brigade at least initially refused to give the money back. Citigroup told a federal court in New York that it intended to make interest payments on Revlon’s behalf but transferred amounts more than 100 times greater.

The bundles start at $14.95 a month for a tier including Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and 50 GB of iCloud storage. That lower tier will also have a $19.95 version for families. A Premier tier costs $29.95, adding Apple News+, Apple Fitness+ and 2TB of iCloud storage.

Apple and Google will also be asked to remove the two downloads from their respective U.S. app stores. Oracle Corp. has been the recent frontrunner in a deal to keep TikTok operating in its second-largest market, confirming plans earlier this week to be a "trusted technology partner" to ByteDance, TikTok's China-based owner, in a complicated proposal put to the U.S. Treasury Department.

2020-09-21	ba	A whistle-blower at Boeing Co. is urging aviation regulators to add additional protections to the grounded 737 Max. Curtis Ewbank, who has previously raised concerns about the plane’s design with congressional investigators, said in comments filed with the Federal Aviation Administration that a proposal to mandate fixes to the jet didn’t address multiple hazards identified in the two fatal Max accidents and earlier incidents involving the 737. “Clearly more actions are required to revise FAA processes so that it accurately assesses airplane design and regulates in the public interest,” Ewbank said in the comments, posted on the Regulations.gov website. Ewbank said the FAA and Boeing should do more to prohibit faulty readings from the sensor implicated in both crashes and improve the plane’s warning systems. In addition, the agency should do a broader review of how pilots react to emergencies and do a more thorough redesign of the flight-control system, he said.

Based on the results, the group receiving the Opdivo-Cabometyx regimen saw their median progression-free survival doubled compared with sunitinib alone, the companies said. The group also demonstrated a superior objective response rate and a longer duration of response. The regimen was well-tolerated and gave better health-related quality of life to the patients.

2020-09-21	jpm	A new investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists says JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc were among the global banks who “kept profiting from powerful and dangerous players” in the past two decades even after the U.S. imposed penalties on these financial institutions. The documents detailed more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity, the report said. Almost 90 financial institutions appear in the roughly 2,100 documents obtained, a fraction of the 2 million reports filed annually. Banks moved money for people or entities they couldn’t identify, and in many cases failed to file the required suspicious activity reports until years afterward, according to the investigation released over the weekend. The report, based on leaked documents obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with the consortium, said that in some cases the banks kept moving illicit funds after receiving warnings from U.S. officials. The top two banks are Deutsche Bank, which disclosed $1.3 trillion of suspicious money in the files, and JPMorgan, which disclosed $514 billion, the analysis found.
2020-09-21	orcl	Oracle Corp shares are set to open at a record high Monday, while Walmart jumped the most in nearly three weeks, even as key questions over the nature of the pair's multi-million investment in China based video sharing app TikTok continue to cloud the weekend deal. Oracle and Walmart agreed to take a collective 20% stake in TikTok Global, a new company carved out of Beijing-based ByteDance that would include all operations outside of China. The company also added it was a 'rumor' that TikTok Global would be controlled by American investors, noting that its majority owners, its proprietary technology as well as the weight of its executive board, would remain China-based. "The current plan does not involve the transfer of any algorithms and technologies,' ByteDance said. "Oracle has the authority to check the source code of TikTok USA." The statement contradicts several key tenets of the President Donald Trump claimed to have brokered over the weekend, in which he claimed TikTok's new ownership would "have nothing to do with any outside land, any outside country. It will have nothing to do with China."

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remains confident that Trump will sign off on the transaction, but U.S. national security officials continue to raise concerns that the data of more than 100 million American users would remain in the hands of a Chinese firm, according to four people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials are bracing for Trump to reject the deal if it becomes obvious that it doesn’t meet criteria the president himself laid out publicly, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. For now, Trump has delayed by one week an order that would have shut down TikTok in the U.S. on Sunday. He could keep extending that deadline until the details of the deals are resolved, two of the people said.

2020-09-23	orcl	An agreement on the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations approved by Washington last weekend is a "dirty and underhanded trick" based on "bullying and extortion," state-owned English language newspaper China Daily wrote in an editorial. The White House last weekend approved a deal that quickly showed the three signatory companies at odds over its interpretation. TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, said it would own 80% of a new TikTok Global entity, while Oracle (ticker: ORCL) and Walmart (WMT), its U.S. future partners, insisted instead that they would control the company. Global Times, an English language version of the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, also denounced the Trump-approved deal on Wednesday, proclaiming in a headline that China would not "allow the U.S. to rob TikTok." The paper also quoted an expert describing Oracle's founder Larry Ellison as "definitely an anti-China person."
2020-09-23	uber	The Labor Department on Tuesday announced a proposal that could deem millions of janitors, construction workers and gig workers to be contractors rather than employees, its most ambitious step toward blessing the business practices of companies like Uber and Lyft. Unlike employers, companies that rely on contractors don’t have to pay a minimum wage, overtime or a share of Social Security taxes, or contribute to unemployment insurance and provide workers' compensation insurance. The proposal is a so-called interpretive rule, not a regulation that has the force of law. But it could have significant influence were it to be finalized. It would technically cover only laws that the Labor Department enforced, like the federal minimum wage and overtime rules. States and other federal agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, would be free to make their own determinations, as California has done in a recently enacted law that effectively requires companies like Uber and Lyft to classify their workers as employees.

2020-09-30	mu	shares slid in the extended session Tuesday after the chip maker noted challenges going forward after nearly doubling its profit and adding more than $1 billion in sales from last year thanks to strong cloud and consumer sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Micron reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $988 million, or 87 cents a share, compared with $561 million, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were $1.08 a share, compared with 56 cents a share in the year-ago period. Revenue rose to $6.06 billion from $4.87 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast earnings of 98 cents a share on revenue of $5.89 billion. Fourth-quarter results were driven by strong DRAM sales in cloud, PC and gaming consoles and an increase in QLC NAND shipments. DRAM sales made up 72% of revenue at $4.4 billion, and NAND sales came in at $1.5 billion. Compute and network sales made up $3.02 billion of revenue driven by cloud, gaming and work-from-home. Mobile sales made up $1.46 billion of revenue for the quarter. Micron said it expects adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings of 40 cents to 54 cents a share on revenue of $5 billion to $5.4 billion, while analysts had forecast earnings of 66 cents a share on revenue of $5.27 billion. Micron also said it does not know when it will get a license to be able to sell again to one of its largest customers, Chinese telecommunications-equipment company Huawei, which was blocked by the Trump administration from receiving U.S. chip products. Micron said sales to Huawei, which made up 10% of fourth-quarter sales, were halted on Sept. 14. Micron's fourth quarter ended on Sept. 3.
